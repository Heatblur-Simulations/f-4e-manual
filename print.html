<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>we are proud to present to you the <strong>Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II</strong> for
Digital Combat Simulator. We’ve spent years of development and countless hours
of research to bring you the most in-depth recreation of this legendary aircraft
ever made. You will be able to fly your Phantom both as a pilot and WSO, alone
with the <strong>JESTER-AI</strong> - your own WSO AI - or in multiplayer together with a friend.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/phantom_flying_back.jpg" alt="Phantom from back" /></p>
<p>But not only did we recreate the Phantom’s flight model, systems, avionics,
radar, RWR and weapons delivery faithfully, we also tried to innovate our
approach to flight simulation in general with the module, laying important
groundwork for our future modules and as always trying to push the boundaries of
flight simulation just a little bit further. From small <strong>quality of life
improvements</strong> like being able to write on your canopy, to an <strong>interactive crew
chief</strong>, our Phantom also utilizes our next-gen components based simulation framework - the
aircraft is simulated as a connection of <strong>thousands of individual components</strong>.
From an instrument needle to control surfaces, each component influences the
state of the aircraft and even comes with its own <strong>wear and tear</strong>. From simulating
accurate power draw from the power source to the smallest light bulb and all the
nodes along the way, from hydraulic fluid which moves the hydraulics which in
turn move the flight surfaces all the way to a mass physics based model - things
now happen naturally, influenced by each other, and not <em>scripted</em> anymore.
Whether that means that unstable power draw may cause a lamp to flicker, or that
you can deploy your landing gear in case of a failure using gravity, or that
correct and incorrect use of the aircraft influences the wear and tear of each
single component individually - we never before attempted a simulation as deep
as with the F-4E Phantom II. The DCS: F-4 represents some of the most immersive
<strong>cold war fighter jet simulation</strong> available!</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/simulation_depth_wide.jpg" alt="Pilot Cockpit Details" /></p>
<p>Such innovation and in depth simulation will present an increased
learning curve for users. This is why it was important for us to also
innovate on the side of learning tools available to you, starting with this
manual, so that our modules are accessible to the casual simmer and aficionado
alike. You can <strong>open the manual in flight</strong>, and read along, but better still, you
can click any switch (with an input combo) in flight and the manual will open in
the correct chapter, <strong>explaining the switch</strong> or system in the cockpit, all while
you are bolting through the air in your thunderous jet. We also changed the
underlying structure of the manual to move to an <strong>open source</strong> model. This will allow the
community to easily contribute via GitHub, as two heads (or thousands of them) think
better than one. As an added benefit, readability for the mobile version will be greatly improved as
well. We have hyperlinked many items for you, providing easy <strong>navigation</strong> between cockpit diagrams
and system overviews. Also featured in the manual are numerous checklists and procedures, and a
<strong>"Lessons" section</strong>, which is planned to be featured with the Early Access Release of the Phantom.
The fully written out lessons will complement the flyable training missions. The training missions
are now tailored to be learned together with the written lesson in the manual, you will
be able to revert steps in the training mission, able to read along and pause
(no more restarting for missed items). With all of these features at your disposal, you will be able
to adequately prepare yourself for your training. And best of all, during your training you will be
instructed by real life F-4 pilots and a real life F-4 WSO Instructor! Who else could teach you
better?</p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy both learning and flying the F-4E Phantom II - dive as
deep as your heart desires. For this exciting journey we wish you <strong>good luck and
many fun adventures</strong>, and of course: always check six!</p>
<p>In the name of the entire Heatblur Team,<br />

<em>Mockup of the F-4 with AIM-7 Missiles</em></p>
<p>The developmental onset of the <strong>F-4 Phantom II</strong> began in the aftermath of
McDonnell's loss in the US Navy's 1953 <strong>Day Fighter Competition</strong> - the victor
of which was the <strong>Vought F8U</strong>. Choosing not to rest on failure, McDonnell
representatives canvased the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, a number of operational
commands, the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and any pilot or
maintainer willing to discuss the state of current naval aviation.</p>
<p>After nearly a year of analysis and design work - including a full scale mockup,
the design of what they would classify as a <strong>general fighter</strong> took shape. The
potential of a general fighter aircraft, rather than the specialized focus
preferred by the Navy at the time, was rooted in the success of the <strong>F3H-1
Demon</strong> in threading of that very needle.</p>
<h3 id="f3h-1-demon"><a class="header" href="#f3h-1-demon">F3H-1 Demon</a></h3>
<p>The Demon had been built as design in opposition of the <strong>F4D Skyray</strong> in the
interceptor role. As the Skyray proved its supersonic superiority during the
development cycle, McDonnell expanded the F3H Demon's capabilities to include
respectable air to ground armament to justify its place in the limited carrier
compliment when compared to the <strong>F10F Jaguar</strong> and <strong>F7U Cutlass</strong>, which were
also undergoing development at the time.</p>
<p>Ultimately outfitted with the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow - the latter
giving the F3H a beyond visual range capability the Skyray could never boast,
and topping out with the ability to carry and deliver 6,000 lbs of air to ground
ordnance, the Demon out-measured its competitors in combat potential, even when
it came in second on paper for raw performance.</p>
<p>Beginning with the intention to grow out the Demon as the baseline airframe, a
set of engineering evaluations were performed including both single and twin
engine configurations with different wings. The two most promising data sets-
twin-engine builds of the type designated the <strong>F3H-G</strong> and <strong>F3H-H</strong> powered
the General Electric J65 and J79 respectively, replaced the original Demon wing
with a 45 degree swept wing.</p>
<p>Particular focus was paid towards making the new aircraft <strong>multi-mission
capable</strong>, running a wide gamut of potential operations: day or all-weather
attack, photo recon, day or all-weather interception with a Sparrow-compatible
radar, electronic warfare, and a two seat strike coordination configuration.
Experimentation with this wide-ranging design intent went so far as to include a
novel interchangeable nose and cockpit arrangement, allowing airframes to be
reconfigured within a matter of hours for a given mission set with the necessary
systems fit for the crew.</p>
<p>While the Navy showed little interest in the nose replacement capability, the
bottom line numbers from the F3H-G and -H investigations got their attention. On
paper, they were capable of reaching Mach 1.52, and an eye-watering Mach 1.97 at
35,000 feet, respectively.</p>
<p>By October of 1954, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) had evaluated similar
unsolicited proposals from Grumman, Douglas, and North American, and provided
McDonnell with a $38 million dollar contract for two flying examples of the
Demon follow on - internally designated as the <strong>AH-1</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/F3HG.jpg" alt="McDonnell F3H-G Mockup" />
<em>McDonnell F3H-G mockup; US Navy photo</em></p>
<h3 id="ah-1"><a class="header" href="#ah-1">AH-1</a></h3>
<p>Two months later, the Navy threw McDonnell a curveball, directing the type to be
<strong>stripped of the air to ground fitment</strong>, and focusing on the all-weather
interceptor role in a single seat configuration, with the finalization for this
change in role being formally announced in April of 1955.</p>
<p>The changeover was, in some quarters, considered catastrophic - over time
forcing the removal of the planned internal gun, and stripping all of the
hard-points, save for the recessed Sparrow fuselage wells and a centerline tank
position. At this point, the determination of the <strong>J79</strong> as the power plant was
finalized with the Navy's desire for a Mach 2 interceptor. Further, the
determination of a two-man crew as also put in place by the Navy - like
McDonnell's own research, success in the faster, longer ranged interception
environment showed the utility of a second man to handle the scope.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't a done deal. BuAero had been keeping conversation with Vought
at the same time, and in mid-1955 detailed a fly-off between the two competing
firms for the new interceptor role; this time pitting McDonnell's AH-1 contender
with an outgrowth of the already in-service <strong>Crusader</strong>: the <strong>F8U-3</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="f4h-f-4a"><a class="header" href="#f4h-f-4a">F4H (F-4A)</a></h3>
<p>Redesignated the <strong>F4H</strong> (or also <strong>F-4A</strong>) in the intervening two and a half
years leading into the late 1958 fly-off, McDonnell's Phantom II would trade
substantial blows with Vought's Crusader III during the Navy Preliminary
Evaluation. Whereas McDonnell's design entered the flight testing phase a month
prior (and nominally entered engineering almost a year ahead of Vought's entry),
the benefits of Vought carrying over much of the prior Crusader's aerodynamic
profile appeared early in the comparison. The Crusader III was first to reach
Mach 2 in flight testing, shown capable of reaching higher top speeds during the
Navy preliminary evaluation, and noted for having more refined airframe handling
in most regimes.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/f-4h_aboard_uss_independence.jpg" alt="f-4h_aboard_the_uss_independence" />
<em>F-4H aboard the USS Independence in 1960; US Navy photo</em></p>
<p>But as the Evaluation continued, it was found that McDonnell's Phantom II
countered the Crusader III where it mattered: in <strong>combat capability</strong>. The Navy
wanted a Mach 2 interceptor, not an overgrown daylight fighter.</p>
<p>The F8U-3's integration of the Sparrow was found lacking versus that of the
Phantom, having surrendered an AIM-7 against the F4H due to aerodynamic
performance concerns. Of even greater concern for the interceptor role - as
McDonnell had previously found internally, the pilot overhead to manage the
AN/APG-74 radar installation in the Crusader III while in combat was found to be
too high to maintain effectiveness, whereas the back-seater in the Phantom II
could reliably acquire situational awareness on the radar and maintain track
locks for engagement while maneuvering.</p>
<p>McDonnell's F4H, while having more raw flying qualities, could fight as the Navy
needed it to. Further, as the firm had continued developing its air to ground
potential at the request of the Navy, even as they repeatedly altered the
program goals - the Phantom II, like the Demon before it, justified its
existence in the carrier compliment in all fights, not just the long range
interception role. And so on December 17th, 1958, the Navy Preliminary

McDonnell's Phantom II</strong>.</p>

<p>The US Air Force was not oblivious to the Phantom II's development, as the Navy
having asked for the air to ground capability be revisited gave McDonnell a
point of entry. While the Air Force entertained McDonnell representatives in
discussion about a new ground attack airframe, the service actually had interest
in the Sparrow-dealing F4H as a replacement for the <strong>F-106</strong>.</p>
<p>The Air Defense Command requested an evaluation in 1961 known as <em>Project High
Speed</em>, which once again proved the Phantom II superior to a challenger in the
interceptor role. In light of the findings, Navy offered a bombing demonstration
for Air Force representatives of the Tactical Air Command, making special note
of the successful air to ground trials with the Phantom's multiple ejector
racks - a capability the USAF lacked. With Air Force policymakers, members of
Congress, and even General Curtis LeMay in attendance during this demonstration
series - with a VX-5 F4H-1 accurately delivering twenty-two 500 lb bombs in
spectacular fashion, the stage was set for a Navy/McDonnell tactical aviation
coup.</p>

<p>The inauguration of the Kennedy administration in January 1961 didn't hurt
matters; Kennedy brought in former Ford Motor Company president Robert McNamara
as Secretary of Defense. With an eye for optimization - sometimes to a fault,
the performance of McDonnell's F4H was seen as a standout to capitalize upon in
light of the administration's new conventional doctrine of <em>"Flexible
Response"</em>; no longer would nuclear deterrence be the primary backstop of the
US' promise to NATO.</p>
<p>While McNamara desired for the Navy's <strong>A-7</strong> and the Air Force's <strong>F-111</strong> to
fulfill tactical bombing roles for both services, the two airframes were at
least five years out to operational capability; the Phantom existed, provided
outstanding performance immediately, and could quickly raise the desired 50%
increase in conventional force structure the White House expected for the Air
Force. Pressure from all sides - the White House, Congress, McDonnell, and
foreign interest, ultimately defeated the USAF's resistance to an airframe <em>"not
made here"</em>, and by January 1962 the USAF's budget had <strong>Phantoms on order from the
Tactical Air Command</strong>; the Air Defense Command, which had started the Air
Force's investigation into the Phantom, would be left with the <strong>F-106</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="f-110-spectre"><a class="header" href="#f-110-spectre">F-110 Spectre</a></h3>
<p>Designated for a time as the <strong>F-110</strong> to fit in with the Air Force's Century
Series as a matter of service pride, McDonnell's Air Force Phantom went into
motion. An initial delivery of Navy-configured F4Hs were provided for training
and evaluation later that year, with the first flight of a true <strong>F-4C</strong> taking
place on May 27th, 1963 - the universal service designation system converting
the F4H-1 to the <strong>F-4B</strong> in September of 1962.</p>
<h3 id="f-4b-and--c"><a class="header" href="#f-4b-and--c">F-4B and -C</a></h3>
<p>Reconfiguration of the Phantom II for the USAF was expedient, with the focus
being on service-compliant alterations. These included altering of the landing
gear system for higher speed field operations, the addition of dual flight
controls, an anti-skid implementation, and conversion to boom refueling
compatibility.</p>
<p>Further changes included the addition of the LN-12 inertial navigation system,
conversion to the APQ-100 radar with air to ground specific functionality, and a
cartridge starting system for field use without a compressed air cart in
combination with an internal battery.</p>
<p>This F-4C configuration would be the first Phantom used during the USAF's
involvement in <strong>Vietnam</strong>, beginning in December of 1964.</p>

<em>F-4B dropping bombs over Vietnam; US Navy Photo</em></p>
<p>The Phantom's initial deployments to Southeast Asia delivered a number of
firsts - the first officially <strong>confirmed MiG-17 kill</strong> with the AIM-9
Sidewinder (on July 10th, 1965), and the first US air-to-air <strong>shootdown of a
MiG-21</strong> (April 26th, 1966). Unfortunately, the Phantom was also the victim of
the <strong>first US loss to a SAM</strong> in Vietnam (July 24th, 1965), and the first US
air-to-air <strong>loss from a MiG-21</strong> (October 5th, 1966).</p>
<p>With the initial teething problems of the type out of the way - including
alterations to the wing fuel cells and internal wiring, the Phantom was found to
be a capable, reliable airframe for the Air Force. Even the missing gun had been
worked around to some degree, with the integration of the SUU-16 and SUU-23
<strong>external cannon pods</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="f-4d"><a class="header" href="#f-4d">F-4D</a></h3>
<p>The in-production upgrade to the Air Force's first Phantom - the <strong>F-4D</strong>, would
include a multitude of quality of life improvements: the APQ-109 radar with air
to ground modes, the ASN-63 internal navigation system, the ASQ-92 release
computer, and the APX-80 "Combat Tree" IFF system. Further additions would
include automatic fuel transfer and a new sight, the ASG-22. Combat
survivability would be reinforced with the APS-107 RHAW and ECM pod
compatibility, along with new ejection seats. Yet, the service's desire to put
its own <em>"made here"</em> flourish on the type continued, inauspiciously culminating
in the integration of the <strong>AIM-4 Falcon</strong> with the F-4D model.</p>
<h4 id="aim-9-vs-aim-4"><a class="header" href="#aim-9-vs-aim-4">AIM-9 vs AIM-4</a></h4>
<p>Used on the <strong>F-102 Delta Dagger</strong> and <strong>F-106 Delta Dart</strong>, and considered by
some to be a reasonable competitor to the <strong>AIM-9 Sidewinder</strong>, Air Force
leadership believed the AIM-4 Falcon could be installed in replacement of the
Navy's short range round with no loss of capability; this was quickly found to
be a mistaken premise.</p>
<p>While the AIM-9B had limited maneuvering restrictions for launch and acquisition
like other short range infrared missiles of its generation, it was substantially
more reliable in use; the Falcon's cooling implementation could only maintain
the required seeker temperature for a short time once activated, and could not
be turned back on once the cooler timed out, while the un-cooled 9B could remain
available indefinitely.</p>
<p>Sidewinder acquired far more rapidly - in many instances in less than two
seconds, versus the six to seven seconds required for the Falcon.</p>
<p>Worse still, the AIM-4 was a hittile - its fin-contact triggered fuzing required
direct target impact for the missile's warhead to detonate, whereas the AIM-9
carried a proximity fuze; any Sidewinder that got close to its target was a
threat to kill.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/F-4Ds_435th_TFS_over_Vietnam.jpg" alt="f4_over_vietnam" />
<em>F-4D of the 435th TFS over Vietnam</em></p>
<p>With initial F-4D deliveries to the 8th TFW in May of 1967, the performance of
the new configuration was quickly met with derision. The employment envelope was
too small compared to the Sidewinder, the lead time too long, and the weapon far
too unreliable to put into practice in the dynamic maneuvering environment of
air combat as it was waged in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The failure of the Falcon to succeed not only served to reaffirm the quality of
the Sidewinder in comparison - and also highlighting the need for the service to
upgrade the round as the Navy was doing, but reinforced the concern held by
aircrews about the lack of an internal gun. SUU installations by this point had
scored multiple victories over North Vietnamese MiGs (ultimately ending the war
with <strong>9 confirmed kills</strong>), and it was decided to rectify what many had
considered the Phantom's original sin with further revision to the F-4.</p>
<h3 id="f-4e"><a class="header" href="#f-4e">F-4E</a></h3>
<p>By this time McDonnell was laying down the program update plan for the F-4E, and
the jet was intended to carry the M61A1 gun internally, and with it - the Hughes
CORDS (Coherent On Receive Doppler System) radar. Hughes was unable to
successfully deliver their CORDS system, and the Westinghouse APQ-120 radar
would be selected in January 1968 as its replacement. The APQ-120 was a full
solid state conversion of the APQ-109/117, re-engineered to meet the
requirements of the internal cannon installation. The radar would receive
changes to its mount, additional dampening, and a reduction antenna's height to
fit in the smaller cavity directly above the cannon barrel assembly.</p>
<p>Further adjustments to the F-4E were made to improve the Phantom's lethality.
Hardware deleted for Sidewinder compatibility in the F-4D was updated and
returned. The ASG-26A Lead Computing Optical Sighting System was installed along
with updated aircrew in-range and shoot warning cues, providing pilots with a
clearer picture of the weapons envelopes of the Sparrow and Sidewinder. The
updates to the Echo Phantom would not stop there; compatibility with
multi-ejection racks and updates to the Weapon Release Computer to match
provided further bombing capabilities, the <strong>AGM-65 Maverick</strong> was made
available in both IR and electro-optical variants, the leading edge of the wings
were fitted with slats for increased maneuvering potential, and the Digital Scan
Converter Group interface for the APQ-120 was installed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the F-4E's initial deliveries from October of 1967 would align
its operational entry with the drawdown of the US' Rolling Thunder bombing
campaign over North Vietnam. The type would have to wait until 1972 to put the
true extent of the jet's upgrades to the test. With the resumption of the air
campaign in February of that year, the E-model Phantom II would fly thousands of
missions, and in the span of seventeen months score <strong>21 air to air kills</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="training-program-rivet-haste"><a class="header" href="#training-program-rivet-haste">Training Program Rivet Haste</a></h3>
<p>Also of note was Rivet Haste - a late Vietnam training initiative in 1972
heavily influenced by two midlife updates - modification "556" and TISEO.</p>
<p>Prior to "556", weapons mode changes required the pilot to go hands off the
throttle and look down to the release panel, cycling a number of switches to
disarm various pylons and arm others; in the event of a lucky North Vietnamese
bounce, or the need to swap between weapons on the fly - looking away from the
threat was time-consuming and dangerous.</p>
<p>With the modification, a pair of override switches were added to the outboard
throttle grip. The first, the <em>"pinky"</em> switch, placed control of the gun,
Sidewinder, and Sparrow in one of three positions, while the second, on the
forward face of the grip, switched weapons modes immediately between air-to-air
and air to ground; the pilot would now have immediate access to his air-to-air
weapons, and could swap them on the fly - never once looking down in the
cockpit. This modification gave birth to the concept called HOTAS - hands on
throttle and stick.</p>
<p>556 also included modifications to the armament panel for air to ground
munitions, adding ripple release capability while reducing the number of
controls required to access full ARBCS programming.</p>
<h3 id="tiseo-upgrade"><a class="header" href="#tiseo-upgrade">TISEO Upgrade</a></h3>
<p>Further reinforcement of crew initiative was the installation of TISEO - the
Target Identification System Electro-Optical, in 1974.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/real_life_f_4_tiseo.jpg" alt="real_life_f_4_with_tiseo" />
<em>An F-4E Phantom II with a TISEO mounted on left wing above the blue practice bombs</em></p>
<p>Consisting of a 4x/10x camera installed in the left wing, TISEO provided visual
identification of distant, radar-locked targets, enabling the AIM-7 Sparrow to
be used to its full extent when combined with the APX-80 IFF system. Crews could
now independently confirm two ID factors before the merge, entering the fight
with more of an advantage - even if they would not be cleared to fire beyond
visual range.</p>
<p>Coupled with the Rivet Haste training - which put experienced aircrews through a
program to codify them as systems and tactics instructors (not unlike the NFWS
education being given to USN crews at the same time), the students championed
the modification program of the Phantom, and pushed for Double Attack (a
parallel development of Loose Deuce as had been used by the Navy in Vietnam
since the resumption of the bombing campaign) to become the standard for
air-to-air methodology across the Air Force.</p>
<p>While this training was ultimately too late to have real effect, with the final
halt on US bombing coming just weeks after the first Haste student crews
returned to Vietnam, they would set the tone for USAF Phantom crews going
forward.</p>
<h2 id="1975-1991-a-cold-warrior"><a class="header" href="#1975-1991-a-cold-warrior">1975-1991: A Cold Warrior</a></h2>
<p>As the Vietnam War drew to a close, the F-4E transitioned from active combatant
to cold warrior. While the F-15 and F-16 both stood on the horizon to take the
premiere positions in tactical air to air and air to ground roles, the sheer
depth of the Phantom's numbers across the USAF and its allies meant the F-4E
would remain at the tip of the spear for another two decades.</p>
<p>Keeping the F-4 effective as a strike platform and air to air combatant was
vital, and the E's capabilities continued to be expanded into the 1980s.
Provision for the all-aspect AIM-9L and M Sidewinders would be installed, as
well as the improved AIM-7F, and later, the AIM-7M Sparrow. The
television-guided GBU-15, with its required <strong>data-link system</strong>, would be
integrated in the Phantom beginning in 1975. To deliver additional guided
munitions the F-4E would receive not one, but two targeting pod options - <strong>Pave
Spike</strong> and <strong>Pave Tack</strong>.</p>
<p>Of particular note is the installation of the Digital Modular Avionics System,
or <strong>DMAS</strong>. DMAS was a complete replacement of the Phantom's navigation
computer, inertial navigation set, and the WRCS, which used LORAN (<strong>Lo</strong>ng
<strong>Ra</strong>nge <strong>N</strong>avigation) radio signals to accurately define the aircraft's position
anywhere in the world. The inclusion of DMAS provided a substantial improvement
in the F-4E's navigation options and weapon release precision, and an expansion
of the Phantom's delivery mode capabilities.</p>
<p>The F-4E would see its front line service end in the United States Air Force
immediately following Operation Desert Storm, with the last remaining users of
the type withdrawn from active duty service. US Air National Guard units would
maintain the type until the mid-90s, with various units seeing them replaced by
other types as appropriate for their respective missions and locations.</p>
<h2 id="the-f-4e-phantom-ii-today"><a class="header" href="#the-f-4e-phantom-ii-today">The F-4E Phantom II Today</a></h2>
<p>Of all Phantom models, the F-4E was the most numerous version that has been
built totalling at <strong>1370 units</strong>.</p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II is still in service at some operators across NATO including
the Hellenic Air Force, the South Korean Air Force and the Turkish Air Force.</p>
<p>They are expected to fly at least <strong>until 2030</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="variant-overview"><a class="header" href="#variant-overview">Variant Overview</a></h2>

<p>The F-4's legacy did not stop at the US border. Its performance made it of
interest to many US allies of its era, and the Phantom II remains in limited
service as of this writing. With the F-4E being the most numerous of the type,
it was natural it would be the model with the furthest reach.</p>
<p>Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of military technology, foreign operators of
the F-4E undertook comprehensive upgrades and modernization efforts. These
initiatives were aimed at extending the aircraft's service life and enhancing
its combat capabilities. The F-4E, with its powerful
engines, evolved to meet the demands of contemporary warfare, solidifying its
place as a venerable platform in the arsenals of its adoptive nations.</p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II's foreign service was not merely a chapter in the history of
military aviation but a saga that unfolded across continents and through the
corridors of geopolitical power. Its adaptability, longevity, and combat prowess
etched the Phantom into the collective memory of the nations that flew it,
leaving an enduring legacy in the skies it once dominated.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/real_life_greek_phantom_lands_riat.jpg" alt="real_life_f_4e_greece_lands_in_riat" />

<h2 id="israel"><a class="header" href="#israel">Israel</a></h2>
<p>The first nation to receive the F-4E on export, Israel, designated it <strong>Kurnass
(Sledgehammer)</strong>.</p>
<p>Phantom would see combat with the IAF within months of delivery, seeing multiple
kills in the war of attrition against Egypt and skirmishes with Syria. The 1973
Yom Kippur War would see the Phantom acquit itself spectacularly, downing 85
Arab aircraft in exchange for 5 lost in air combat. But it was the Phantoms
performance as an air to ground asset that would draw the most focus from the
IAF, seeing the F-4E specializing in that role as the F-15 and F-16 were made
available to the nation for export purchase.</p>
<p>The Kurnass would ultimately receive a number of vital upgrades to keep the type
viable beginning in 1987, with the installation of the APG-76 radar, a new
mission computer and HUD, and the ability to deliver the Popeye air to surface
missile. The IAF would ultimately receive between 212 and 222 F-4Es.</p>
<h2 id="australia"><a class="header" href="#australia">Australia</a></h2>
<p>Australia would be the second import customer for the F-4E, but only on a
limited time basis. Twenty-four F-4Es were provided to the RAAF on a lease basis
by the United States as a stopgap measure due to delays in deliveries of the
F-111C.</p>
<p>The F-4E would operate in Australian service for just three years, beginning in
September of 1970 to 1973. Australian aircrews were impressed with the Phantom's
performance for their needs, and while the US offered to let the RAAF buy the
leased airframes outright, this offer was ultimately rejected.</p>
<h2 id="japan"><a class="header" href="#japan">Japan</a></h2>
<p><img src="intro/../img/JASDF_F-4_Phantoms.jpg" alt="JASDF F-4 starting" />
<em>F-4EJ Kais of the JASDF of the 8th Hikōtai taking off in 2002, US Navy Photo</em></p>
<p>With permission of the US State Department and license terms with McDonnell
Douglas, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would build the F-4E locally, designated as
the F-4EJ. The -4EJ would be provided compatibility with Japanese built weapons,
but the omission of the refueling probe and AJB-7 bombing computer due to treaty
restrictions on the JASDF.</p>
<p>The -4EJ was updated as the 'Kai' in 1984, receiving the APG-66J radar and ASM-1
and - 2 anti-shipping missiles. The F-4EJ would serve Japan over 40 years, with
the final examples being withdrawn in March of 2021.</p>
<h2 id="iran"><a class="header" href="#iran">Iran</a></h2>
<p>First receiving the F-4E in 1971, the IIAF received 177 F-4Es through various
delivered batches into the late 1970s. In the aftermath of the Iranian
Revolution, now-IRIAF F-4Es saw extensive use - and numerous successes, against
the forces of Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The first raid on the Osirak Nuclear Plant in September of 1980 was performed by
four F-4Es, damaging the reactor and control facilities; this raid preempted the
more famous IAF attack on the same facility that destroyed it permanently. In
like fashion, April of 1981 saw F-4E's as the primary strike aircraft during the
raid on all three airfields of the H-3 complex in western Iraq.</p>
<p>The conflict with Iraq came at substantial cost to both airframes and crews,
with western weapons embargoes severely limiting the ability of the IRIAF to
maintain the Phantom II effectively. By the end of the war, even local estimates
put the available number of flyable F-4s below four dozen. While local industry
attempted to revitalize the Phantom in the aftermath of the conflict, current
evaluations put their total F-4 force near 60, between their remaining F-4D,
F-4E, and RF-4Es.</p>
<h2 id="greece"><a class="header" href="#greece">Greece</a></h2>
<p>The Hellenic Air Force's initial F-4E deliveries began in 1974, with annual
deliveries stopped due to politics in 1981. The HAF's combined Phantom II force
topped out at 121 airframes purchased (F-4E and RF-4E), with reinforcement
stocks of former USAF jets bringing that number to is final value in the
post-Desert Storm drawdown.</p>
<p>Upgrades by DASA to Greek Phantoms has been extensive, and was built around a
similar model to the Lutfwaffe's F-4F ICE. Most notably, the HAF F-4E has
received the APG-65 for AMRAAM (including a replacement digital BUS), HUD, and
LITENING pod compatibility.</p>
<p>The HAF Phantoms have also received specific upgrades based on their intended
squadron roles, with inertial navigation replacement and GPS inclusion for those
specializing in the air to surface role. Greece currently retains over 30
Phantoms on active duty.</p>
<h2 id="turkey"><a class="header" href="#turkey">Turkey</a></h2>
<p>Turkey's Phantom service has been extensive, with over 160 F-4Es procured (along
with an additional 60+ RF-4Es), beginning in 1974. Deliveries of Phantoms have
been both new build and former USAF, and in the mid-90s, Israeli Aerospace
Industries (IAI) was tapped to bring them into the next century.</p>
<p>Based around a proposed upgrade program for the IAF, the F-4E Terminator 2020
deleted over 1600 lbs of excess weight from the aircraft by wiring and hydraulic
system replacements, integrated the Elta M-2032 radar, a full HOTAS
implementation, MFDs, a true HUD, and extensive weapons systems updates, Popeye
and GBU integration, as well as the LITENING II targeting pod. The Turkish Air
Force intends to maintain the remaining 30 or so airframes in service until the
mid-2030s.</p>

<p>Primarily an F-4F and RF-4E customer - the largest F-4 export recipient with 263

States for the type conversion of their aircrews training alongside USAF units.</p>

<p>A long time F-4 recipient, South Korea supplanted its force of F-4Ds with brand
new F-4Es beginning in 1977, ultimately purchasing a total of 103.</p>
<p>South Korea was the recipient of the final US built F-4 Phantom, 78-0744, in
October of 1979. As of this writing, the RoKAF retains the F-4E in service, with
the intention of withdrawing it in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="egypt"><a class="header" href="#egypt">Egypt</a></h2>
<p>The final F-4E export customer, Egypt, received purchasing rights through its
peace treaty with Israel and the Peace Pharaoh agreement; rather than new build
airframes, Egypt received 35 former USAF aircraft.</p>
<p>The Phantom was ultimately a precursor towards the nation's purchase of the
F-16, and went through initial difficulties in servicing by their maintenance
crews. McDonnell Douglas advisors aided the Egyptian squadrons to get their
operational ready rates back up to standard, and the Phantom II went on to serve
the EAF into the late 90s.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="f-4e-air-to-air-kills"><a class="header" href="#f-4e-air-to-air-kills">F-4E Air to Air Kills</a></h1>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II, an upgraded version of the F-4 Phantom series, played a
significant role in air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War. Equipped with the
AIM-7 Sparrow missile, a radar-guided weapon with beyond-visual-range
capabilities, the F-4E had a notable advantage in engagements.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, F-4E pilots engaged in dogfights against various enemy aircraft. The
Sparrow missile allowed them to target adversaries from a distance, contributing
to the aircraft's success. Key USAF pilots, such as Steve Ritchie and Chuck
DeBellevue, achieved ace status by securing five or more air-to-air victories.</p>
<p>The total number of air-to-air kills attributed to the F-4E Phantom II,
combining both the USAF and USN, is estimated to be around 21 during the Vietnam
War, including 4 MiG-19s and 17 MiG-21s. However, this figure may vary across
sources. In total, F-4C/D/E Variants shot down 107 MiG jets, rewarding it the
nickname <em>"Biggest distributor of MiG parts"</em>.</p>
<p>Despite its effectiveness, the F-4E faced challenges in close-quarters combat
due to the initial absence of an internal cannon. Modifications, including the
addition of an M61 Vulcan cannon, addressed this limitation and improved the
aircraft's performance in close-range engagements.</p>
<p>The success of the F-4E Phantom II in Vietnam solidified its reputation as a
versatile and formidable fighter, and it continued to serve in air forces
worldwide for many years.</p>

<h3 id="interval-knob"><a class="header" href="#interval-knob">Interval Knob</a></h3>
<p>The interval knob (<num>1</num>) provides release pulse sequences between 0.05
second and 1 second.</p>
<h3 id="interval-switch"><a class="header" href="#interval-switch">Interval Switch</a></h3>
<p>The INTRVL switch (<num>2</num>) provides the option of a 10x multiplier of the
set value of the interval knob. In the NORM position, the interval knob value is
the trigger timer.</p>
<h3 id="quantity-knob"><a class="header" href="#quantity-knob">Quantity Knob</a></h3>
<p>The quantity knob (<num>3</num>) controls how many stores are released per
impulse.</p>
<p>Selecting "1" places the AWRU into single manual bombing mode; one push of the
bomb release button releases one bomb.</p>
<p>Selecting a value from "2" to "18" sets the AWRU into single ripple mode; in
this mode, the AWRU will release bombs according to the programmed interval
until the set number of rounds is dropped, or the bomb button is released. Upon
release, the count is reset, and a subsequent press and hold will drop the
programmed number of bombs.</p>
<p>Selecting "C" sets the AWRU into single continuous mode; pressing the bomb
release button drops rounds according to the programmed interval until the bomb
button is released, or all munitions from the selected pylons are expended.</p>
<p>The "P" setting is for pairs manual mode. With at least two stations selected,
each push of the bomb button will release two bombs; like single manual mode,
this does not include an interval function.</p>
<p>Lastly, the "S" setting, for salvo, releases bombs in accordance to the chosen
interval from all selected stations simultaneously, until the bomb button is
released. Ergo, if four stations are selected with a 2 second interval (0.2 on
the interval dial, X10 INTRVL switch setting), four bombs will be released every
two seconds the bomb button is held down.</p>

<p><img src="cockpit/pilot/../../img/pilot_radar_missile_power_switch.jpg" alt="Radar Missile Power Switch" /></p>
<p>The Radar Missile Power Switch provides power to the klystron continuous wave
(CW) emitter responsible for guidance signals. This also powers the Sparrow
tuning drive which is responsible for tuning the Sparrows to the correct
continuous wave carrier frequency for guidance.</p>
<p>When the radar power knob is out of the OFF position, power is applied to the
circuit 30 seconds after this selection.</p>
<p>The STBY position maintains warmup power to the missiles and continuous wave
tuning drive once the missiles have been tuned. This keeps the Sparrows and
Tuning Drive warm, but the Sparrows not tuned.</p>
<p>The CW ON position allows for constant tuning and missile state monitoring with
the radar mode not in TV. This also causes the radar klystron to begin
continuous wave emission.</p>
<p>Tuning can be performed on the ground with the radar in TEST mode to preclude
emissions endangering ground crew.</p>

<p>The throttle arrangement for each engine in the F-4E Phantom II is located on the front and rear
cockpit left console. Mechanical linkage transmits throttle movement to the engine fuel control. A
friction adjusting lever allows customization of throttle friction. Afterburner initiation occurs by
shifting the throttles outboard and moving forward from the MIL position. The Afterburner gate can
be adjusted in the special options of the module.</p>
<p>Throttle movement is smooth and continuous, with afterburner modulation possible throughout the
range. Moving throttles from IDLE to OFF closes the fuel shutoff valve, stopping fuel flow. To
transition from OFF to IDLE or MIL, advance the throttles straight forward. Shifting throttles
outboard allows movement from MIL to MAX, enabling forward motion in the afterburner range. For

<p>The Defog/Foot Heat lever (<num>5</num>) provides pilot selectable volume of warm air to the
windshield for
de-icing purposes or footwell recesses for comfort or visibility.</p>
<p>It is possible, through selection of cold temperature settings,
particularly on humid days, for the air conditioning system to deliver air at temperatures well
below the dew-point, with resultant cockpit fogging. This fog can be dissipated by selecting a
slightly warmer temperature.</p>
<p>When operating in high humidity conditions, it is recommended that a
warmer than normal temperature be selected, prior to starting the takeoff run, to preclude the
possibility of cockpit fogging as thrust is increased. Should cockpit fogging occur, the quickest
means of eliminating this condition is by activating the emergency vent knob.</p>
<p>During cruise
operations, prior to letdown, place the temperature control knob in the 2 o’clock position and the
Defog/Foot Heat Lever to defog, to increase the defog temperature for windshield and canopy
preheating. For airplanes without slats, if the flaps are lowered for letdown and fogging persists,
retract the flaps or increase power (use speed brakes as necessary to maintain airspeed) to provide
higher defogging air flow.</p>

<p>The Primary flight instruments include every instrument needed for basic flight of the F-4E.
Included are the True Airspeed Indicator (TAS), the ground speed indicator, Accelerometers,
combined Airspeed and Mach Indicators, radar and barometric Altimeters, a backup magnetic compass,
vertical velocity indicators, different turn and slip indicators as well as cockpit attitude
indicators.</p>
<h2 id="true-airspeed-indicators"><a class="header" href="#true-airspeed-indicators">True Airspeed Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_true_airspeed_indicator.jpg" alt="TASInd" /></p>
<p>True Airspeed Indicators are provided in both cockpits, and carry a calibrated
range from 150 to 1500 knots. The velocity signal is calculated in the Air Data Computer,
based on the temperature and pressures input. While the indicators can read as low as 0 knots,
the lack of calibration below the stated range means values less than 150 knots
are inaccurate. At high rates of airspeed change, there may be a lag of up to
±10 knots in measurement. During normal operation, an error up to ±5 knots
may be present. If failed, the rollers will be stuck on their position.</p>
<p>The rear True Airspeed Indicator is removed for DMAS equipment in aircraft so
configured; however, TAS is provided as a DMAS function.</p>
<h2 id="ground-speed-indicator-1"><a class="header" href="#ground-speed-indicator-1">Ground Speed Indicator</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/wso_ground_speed_indicator.jpg" alt="wso_ground_speed_indicator" /></p>
<p>A ground speed indicator is provided in the rear cockpit, with a range from 0 to
1999 knots. Ground speed signal is provided by the Navigation Computer, with the source
dependent on INS function. If the INS is online, the ground speed value calculated
is based on the provided velocity, and can display correct information as low as
0 knots. When the INS is offline, the air data computer performs a calculation
using crew-entered wind information, which can cause errors of up to 150
displaying while the aircraft is on the ground with the parking brake set.
If failed, the rollers will be stuck on their position.</p>
<p>With DMAS installed, the rear ground speed indicator is removed, as GS is a DMAS
function.</p>
<h2 id="accelerometers"><a class="header" href="#accelerometers">Accelerometers</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_accelerator.jpg" alt="GGauge" /></p>
<p>Both cockpits retain accelerometers for monitoring G load; the accelerometers
carry 3 needles - one for current G loading, and a positive and negative G
loading needle for the highest load G-load detected since the accelerometer was
reset. To reset the gauge, the PUSH TO SET button will return the recording
pointers to positive 1 G.</p>
<h2 id="airspeedmach-indicators"><a class="header" href="#airspeedmach-indicators">Airspeed/Mach Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_airspeed_mach_indicator.jpg" alt="MachInd" /></p>
<p>Purely mechanical instruments that use total pressure from the Pitot-Static system
and static pressure from the Air Data Computer, previously corrected by the Static
Pressure Compensator before displaying in the gauge.</p>
<p>The airspeed indicator component of this instrument functions by measuring the dynamic
air pressure, which is the difference between the total and the static pressure.
This dynamic pressure is closely related to the square of the aircraft's airspeed.
Inside the indicator, there is a diaphragm or aneroid capsule that reacts to changes
in this dynamic pressure. As the aircraft's speed varies, this diaphragm expands or
contracts accordingly. These mechanical movements are then converted into a reading
displayed on the airspeed dial, showing the aircraft's velocity relative to the air
around it.</p>
<p>The Mach number is determined in a manner akin to measuring airspeed, primarily through
the comparison of dynamic and static air pressures. This comparison reveals the aircraft's
speed relative to the speed of sound.</p>
<p>Found in both cockpits is a combination Airspeed/Mach indicator. The indicators
provide a fixed airspeed scale at the middle of the indicator (<num>1</num>), reading values
from 80 to 850 knots, and a rotating Mach number scale to the outside (<num>2</num>),
with readings from 0.4 to 2.5 Mach. A two position push-and-rotate knob (<num>4</num>) offers both
an airspeed
index with a functional range between 80 and 195 knots (<num>3</num>), and a Mach index pointer
with a range between 225 knots and 850 knots. A small friction error of the needle,
up to 5 kts might sometimes be noticed.</p>
<p>If failed, both the airspeed needle and the mach scale will be stuck in their remaining position.
Mean time to failure is 1000 hours.</p>
<h2 id="altimeter-2"><a class="header" href="#altimeter-2">Altimeter</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_baro_altitude.jpg" alt="Altimeter" /></p>
<p>An AAU-19 Type of altimeter, may operate in both electric - based on corrected electric
static pressure signal from the Altitude Encoder, or mechanical (STBY) mode - from
Air Data Computer, previously corrected by the Static Pressure Compensator.
The errors tolerance of the instrument is ±3 feet below 80kts and ±5 feet above that airspeed.</p>
<p>In STBY mode, the altimeter operates based on an aneroid barometer, featuring a flexible
metal capsule known as an aneroid wafer. This wafer expands or contracts with changes
in external air pressure. As the aircraft ascends, the decrease in air pressure causes
the wafer to expand. Conversely, during descent, the increased air pressure leads
to the wafer's contraction. These mechanical movements are translated via a system
of springs and levers, resulting in the movement of the altimeter's needle and rollers.
The altimeter can be calibrated to the current sea level pressure for accurate altitude
readings.</p>
<p>In the primary mode of operation, the altimeter utilizes an electric servo mechanism
to achieve a precise indication.</p>
<p>Devices in both cockpits provide a functional range from 0 to 80,000 feet. To
the outside of the indicator is a pointer scale (<num>5</num>), gradation in 50 foot units with
markings every 100 feet (from 1 to 10). Left of center is the counter,
increasing and decreasing in value in thousand foot increments on the black pair
of rollers, hundred foot increments on the white (<num>4</num>). Barometric scale (<num>3</num>)
adjustment
can be performed using a dial (<num>1</num>). A three position switch (<num>2</num>) provides the
RESET
function for the altimeter to draw signals from the air data computer for normal
operation, and the STBY (standby) option to only use the pneumatic pressure to
determine altitude. Standby mode is noted with a red flag in the indicator. In
the event of an altimeter or air data computer failure in normal operation, the
STBY flag will appear, and cannot be reset. This can also be followed by
warnings on the telelight panel.</p>
<p>Common failures of the device include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Altimeter Stuck: total damage, all indications are frozen</li>
<li>Electric Servo Failed: the device is forced to turn to the STBY (pressure) mode of operation.</li>
<li>Needle Stuck: needle remains in its position</li>
<li>Altitude Rollers Stuck: altitude rollers remain in their position</li>
<li>Reference Pressure Rollers Stuck: reference pressure rollers remain in their position</li>
<li>Reference Pressure Knob Broken: rotating the knob has no effect on the device</li>
<li>Three Position Switch Broken: rotating the switch has no effect on the device</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="magnetic-compass"><a class="header" href="#magnetic-compass">Magnetic Compass</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_standby_magnetic_compass.jpg" alt="StbyMagComp" /></p>
<p>A magnetic compass is provided in each cockpit for use in the event of a
navigation or electrical system failure.</p>
<p>Due to its design, the compass is subject to several errors. Firstly, it exhibits
a degree of inertia, which often results in a lagging indication. As a result,
oscillations of the needle and its swinging movements may frequently be observed.</p>
<p>To maintain alignment with the Earth's gravity field, it can rotate about 10 degrees
in both the pitch and roll axes. However, because the Earth's magnetic field lines are not
parallel to its surface, the needle tends to 'dip' slightly upward or downward towards the
magnetic poles. This 'dipping' effect causes errors, particularly noticeable during turns
and acceleration.</p>
<p>In the northern hemisphere, the compass will lag when turning from north and
lead when turning towards north. The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>When accelerating
on east or west headings in the northern hemisphere, the compass will erroneously turn towards
the north, and while decelerating, it will turn towards the south. In the southern hemisphere,
the opposite effects occur during acceleration and deceleration.</p>
<h2 id="vertical-velocity-indicators-vvi"><a class="header" href="#vertical-velocity-indicators-vvi">Vertical Velocity Indicators (VVI)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_vertical_velocity_indicator.jpg" alt="VVI" /></p>
<p>VVI Indicators are provided in both cockpits, and show the rate of climb or
descent (in feet per minute) of the aircraft, calculated via atmospheric pressure
change using the pneumatically corrected static pressure from the Air Data Computer.</p>
<p>The device consists of a diaphragm housed within a sealed case. Both the diaphragm
and the space surrounding it are connected to the aircraft's static pressure source.
However, the diaphragm is designed with a calibrated leak, causing the pressure inside
it to change more slowly than that of the surrounding area. This intentional delay results
in a pressure differential between the inside and outside of the diaphragm. The VVI translates
this pressure difference into mechanical movement of a needle, which then displays
the aircraft's rate of climb or descent.</p>
<p>Due to its design, the rate of climb or descent displayed on the indicator is subject to a slight
delay compared to the aircraft's actual vertical movement. This lag in the F-4 ranges between
4 and 7 seconds. The gauge, which measures between -6,000 and 6,000 feet per minute, can have
a positional error of up to 50 fpm, scale errors of up to 300 fpm for rates nearing 5,000 fpm,
and friction errors of a maximum of ±150 fpm. In case of failure, the indicator may become stuck,
or one of its leaks may become clogged. If the Static Pressure Leak is blocked, the needle will gradually
move to a 0 fpm indication as the pressures equalize and remain constant. Conversely, if the
calibrated leak is clogged, the delayed pressure will not change, causing the needle to move with
altitude changes, similar to an altimeter, but quickly reaching its operational limits.
The mean time between failures for this instrument is 1,000 hours.</p>
<h2 id="radar-altimeter-1"><a class="header" href="#radar-altimeter-1">Radar Altimeter</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_radar_altitude.jpg" alt="RadAlt" /></p>
<p>Found in the front cockpit, the Radar Altimeter has a functional range of 0 to
5000 feet above ground level. The radar altimeter functions from 0 to 30 degrees
in bank angle, or 0 to 35 degrees angle in pitch. The dial scale reads from 0 to
5000 feet, and the system includes a red low altitude warning light (<num>2</num>) that
illuminates when the aircraft is detected below a pilot-set altitude.</p>
<p>Activation and setting of the radar altimeter warning height is done with the
same knob (<num>1</num>); turning the knob clockwise initially activates the indicator,
removing the displayed OFF flag; continuing to rotate the knob moves the
reference marker that will determine the altitude which triggers the low
altitude warning. A self-test, initiated by pressing the function control
switch, shows 35 ±15 feet. Above 5000 feet or with unreliable signals, the
pointer hides behind a mask, showing the OFF flag. The OFF appears also when
power is lost; the indicator will then present the last altitude detected above
ground level at the time of this occurring.</p>
<h2 id="turn-and-slip-indicators"><a class="header" href="#turn-and-slip-indicators">Turn and Slip Indicators</a></h2>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>In the front cockpit, a turn and slip indicator is added to the ADI on the
instrument panel; while the needle provides correct direction of turn,
based on the signal from a Rate Gyroscope in the AJB-7 system, it does
not provide proper turn rate information.</p>
<p>A conventional 4-minute turn and slip indicator with its own conventional
horizontally mounted gyro is found on the rear cockpit panel.</p>
<p>To execute a controlled turn (360° in 4 minutes), place the vertical needle of the rear
turn indicator over one of the marks on either side (turn rate of 1.5 degrees per second)
and ensure the slip indicator at the bottom is centered to prevent over- or under-turning
due to incorrect bank.</p>
<h2 id="rear-cockpit-attitude-indicator"><a class="header" href="#rear-cockpit-attitude-indicator">Rear Cockpit Attitude Indicator</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/wso_adi.jpg" alt="Wso_rear_cockpit_attitude_indicator" /></p>
<p>The AJB-7 provides attitude information to the Attitude Indicator found on the
rear cockpit instrument panel regardless of the Reference System Selector Switch
position. A trim knob provides the ability to adjust the attitude sphere to
reference the aircraft correctly. Should power be disconnected from the
indicator or AJB-7, the OFF flag will display.</p>
<p>The device operates electronically and features two servos: a pitch servo and a roll servo.
The pitch indication is limited to a range of ±90 degrees, while the roll indication
allows for continuous movement throughout the entire 360-degree circle. In the event
of a servo failure (with a mean time between failures of 800 hours), the affected servo
will become stuck in its last position or direction.</p>
<h2 id="pitot-static-system"><a class="header" href="#pitot-static-system">Pitot-Static System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ext_pitot_tube.jpg" alt="ext_pitot_tube" /></p>
<p>The Pitot-Static system provides impact and static pressure to flight
instrumentation, the Air Data Computer, and airspeed-driven switches.
A single pitot tube, mounted on the aircraft, provides the total pressure
reading, while static pressure is measured by two static ports situated
on a single boom on the aircraft's nose. Both the pitot tube and static ports
are prone to blockages caused by ice accumulation. To alleviate icing of the pitot head,
a Pitot Heat Switch is found in the front cockpit right console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: The Pitot Heat switch should always be turned on before takeoff as
otherwise the bellows intake could freeze, resulting in flight control issues,
as well as airspeed or altimeter issues. However, the Pitot Heat should not be allowed
to run longer than one minute on the ground without sufficient airspeed, as it could
damage the instrument.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="air-data-computer-system"><a class="header" href="#air-data-computer-system">Air Data Computer System</a></h2>
<p>Using a variety of static, attitude, and environmental inputs, the Air Data
Computer (ADC) provides the pneumatic and electrical inputs to primary flight instruments,
AFCS, Fire Control System, Air Induction System, the INS, the LCOSS, navigational computer,
and manages the variable bypass bell mouth system for the engines. Flight
through weather such as ice or rain can induce errors in the performance of
these systems until the condition has cleared, and this should be taken into
account.</p>

<p>The Static Pressure Compensator (SPC) performs correction of altimeter lag
caused by rapid altitude change. The SPC must be reset after engine startup on
each flight; this is performed using the CADC switch near the throttles by
selecting RESET CORR, then selecting NORM. Should an issue occur during flight
causing a STATIC CORR OFF warning, an attempt to reset the SPC can be performed
with RESET CORR. Should the STATIC CORR OFF warning fail to clear, care must be
taken in all diving maneuvers, as substantial altimeter lag will occur.</p>
<h2 id="alt-encoder-out-light"><a class="header" href="#alt-encoder-out-light">ALT ENCODER OUT Light</a></h2>
<p>The Altitude Encoder Unit provides precise (to 100 feet) altitude data to the

<h2 id="bobweights-vs-bellows"><a class="header" href="#bobweights-vs-bellows">Bobweights vs. Bellows</a></h2>
<p>Linkages between stick, control surfaces and interactions with the trim system,
as well as the AFCS are a complex combination of forces that balance out each
other.</p>
<p>Bobweights connected to the stick increase the force required to move it
depending on the current G-force by pushing the stick forward. For example, when
pulling the stick and generating positive G's, the bobweights get heavier,
making it harder to pull more and naturally leading to the stick wanting to move
back to neutral.</p>
<p>The bobweights are countered from the opposing direction by the bellows
system operated by ram air pressure sensed at the bellows inlet on the vertical
fin.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ext_f4_anti_col_light.jpg" alt="Bellows Inlet" /></p>
<p>The bellows pull the stick aft depending on the relative airspeed.
For example, when going hands of stick and the aircraft unintentionally departing
nose down, airspeed increases and the bellows system pulls the stick aft, naturally
causing the aircraft to pitch up and stabilize in level flight again.</p>
<p>Trimming the aircraft results in changing the length of the lever arm connecting
the bellows system with the stick, changing the effective force they can apply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 Blockage or freezing of the bellows inlet cause the system to malfunction.
In this case, trim can be rendered ineffective and sudden pitch up or down
movements can occur, depending on how the bellows and bobweight forces balance
out. To prevent another sudden change in pitch once the blockage is resolved,
trim should be kept neutral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two opposing forces are carefully balanced out to keep the stick in a
neutral position during level flight at normal airspeeds. However, due to the
dynamic nature of the system, the aircraft constantly has to be retrimmed after
even the smallest flight condition changes. Especially under G's or when changing
airspeed, the feel of the stick behavior changes drastically.</p>
<h2 id="control-sticks"><a class="header" href="#control-sticks">Control Sticks</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_stick.jpg" alt="FlightStick" /></p>
<p>A control stick is provided in both cockpits, with near-uniform switchology
between the two. A Trim Control (<num>1</num>) is found on both sticks to provide force
reduction and minor flight path correction in the pitch and roll axis. Weapons
are deliverable through both a Trigger (<num>3</num>)
(for <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../stores/air_to_air/overview.html">air-to-air missiles</a> and the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../stores/guns.html">gun</a>)
and a Bomb Release Switch (<num>2</num>). Both sticks carry
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.html#nose-gear-steering">Nose Wheel Steering button (<num>5</num>)</a> that
doubles as a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../radar/overview.html">radar</a> auto-acquisition control for the radar in visual

a dual-role control that performs the boom disconnect function its name implies, as well as
a number of weapon selection functions.</p>
<p>Also, unique to the front cockpit stick is a force transducer, to allow the pilot
fine adjustment control of the AFCS with the autopilot functionality engaged. In the event the force
applied to the stick exceeds the AFCS breakout limit, autopilot will be temporarily turned off.</p>

<p>The Aileron-Spoiler Control System and the Stabilator Control System both offer
trim following; the former through a screw jack actuator, the latter using a

These functions cause the stick to position relative
to the current trim and autopilot position when the crew member in control goes
"hands off". It is therefore advisable to maneuver the stick to the same

<p>The limits of
the system are 15° of rudder displacement when the
automatic flight control system is in the stability

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_afcs_control_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_afcs_switches" /></p>
<p>The automatic flight control system (AFCS) is an
electro-hydraulic system designed to provide stable,
accurate, and coordinated flight maneuvers without
interfering with manual control. The automatic flight
control system is capable of performing two modes of
operation, <strong>stability augmentation</strong> and <strong>AFCS</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The term "AFCS" is the name of the whole system but also
its sub-mode in which the aircraft attitude and/or heading
is held and altitude hold can be activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stability augmentation</strong> improves airplane stability in pitch, roll,
and yaw. It opposes any change of attitude but does not
return the airplane to a given attitude or ground track.
This mode of operation may be used while the aircraft is
under manual control. Stability augmentation can be
engaged individually or in any combination for pitch, roll,
or yaw axis.</p>
<p>The <strong>AFCS mode</strong> of operation maintains any
aircraft heading and/or attitude selected within the AFCS
limits and corrects for any deviation from the selected
heading or attitude of the aircraft within the AFCS limits.
The AFCS switch (<num>2</num>) can be engaged with only
the Pitch STAB AUG switch engaged; however, to provide full
AFCS operation, all three STAB AUG switches must be
engaged.</p>
<p>The AFCS system can be engaged and hold maneuvers and
attitudes within a range of ±70° pitch, 70° in bank and 360°
in azimuth, providing the G limits are not being exceeded.
Rapid stabilator movements, whether pilot induced or
not, will cause the AFCS switch to disengage.</p>
<p>If the AFCS switch
is engaged when the airplane is less than ± 5° from wings level,
then the the airplane will maintain a <strong>wings level attitude</strong>,
and will hold the engaged <strong>heading</strong>.
When the nose gear steering button
(on the stick grip) is pressed, heading hold
drops out and <strong>attitude</strong> hold is available. Heading hold
can be re-established by once again pressing the nose
gear steering button. If the airplane attitude is greater
than ± 5° from wings level when the AFCS switch is
engaged, then the airplane will maintain the bank attitude at
the time of engagement.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altitude Hold mode</strong> of operation (<num>3</num>) holds
any altitude selected while in the <strong>AFCS mode</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Altimeter fluctuations while accelerating
through the transonic range (0.9 to 1.0 Mach) will produce
transient fluctuations which, although not violent, may
cause the reference altitude to slip. Engaging the altitude
hold mode in climbs greater than 1000 feet per minute
may result in a reference altitude other than the engage
altitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="force-transducer"><a class="header" href="#force-transducer">Force Transducer</a></h3>
<p>The force transducer senses the physical force applied to
the control stick. This unit comprises the visible
portion of the control stick with the stick grip mounted on
top of it.</p>
<p>The force transducer contains pressure sensitive
switches which react to longitudinal and lateral stick
forces. A lateral stick force of approximately 1.5 pounds
closes a force switch. When a roll force switch closes the
roll rate gyro signal in STAB AUG and the roll rate and
attitude gyro signals in AFCS mode are cut out so that
pilot initiated maneuvers are not opposed while in the
AFCS mode. The pilot maneuvers the aircraft by
mechanical linkages until the lateral stick force is reduced
to less than approximately 1.5 pounds. At this time the roll
channel is returned to normal AFCS operation.</p>
<p>A forward
stick force of 3.75 ±0.25 pounds or an aft stick force of 2.55
±0.25 pounds closes switches to operate certain AFCS
components, and cause a force sensing device to send a
signal, proportional to the applied stick force, to the servo
amplifier and stabilator position is controlled through the
AFCS.</p>
<p>There is no stick force transducer in the rear cockpit. The
AFCS and roll stab aug will oppose rear cockpit stick
inputs. Do not fly the aircraft from the rear cockpit with
AFCS engaged. Exercise care in transferring control
between cockpits while rolling with roll stab aug engaged.</p>
<h3 id="g-limit-accelerometer"><a class="header" href="#g-limit-accelerometer">G-Limit Accelerometer</a></h3>
<p>The normal load factor interlock (G-disengage) feature of
the AFCS is designed to inhibit the system from
commanding excessive load factors on the airplane. The
system reverts automatically from whatever mode is
engaged to stability augmentation in the event that +4 or
-1 G is sensed by the G-disengage
accelerometer switch.</p>
<p>This switch is mounted forward on
the radar bulkhead so that if the airplane is rotated
rapidly into a maneuver, disengagement occurs at lower
values of normal load factor due to the anticipation
resulting from the forward location sensing a component
of pitching acceleration.</p>
<p>The G-disengage feature is
inoperative outside the ±70° limits of the autopilot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: The G switch does not disengage the autopilot
under conditions of low airspeed or heavy gross
weight before the aircraft stalls. If the autopilot
remains engaged during a stall, the autopilot
provides pro-spin controls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="emergency-quick-release-lever-2"><a class="header" href="#emergency-quick-release-lever-2">Emergency Quick Release Lever</a></h3>
<p>A spring-loaded emergency quick release lever is on each
control stick. This lever operates in the same manner from
both the front and the rear cockpits.</p>
<p>Depressing the lever
causes the AFCS and altitude hold switch to return to
OFF. The stability augmentation mode, ARI and
anti-skid, are disengaged as long as the lever is held
depressed. When the lever is released, the stability
augmentation, anti-skid, and ARI are again in operation,
but the AFCS is no longer engaged.</p>
<p>To permanently
disengage the stability augmentation mode, the pitch, roll,
and yaw STAB AUG switches must be placed off. To
permanently disengage the ARI and anti-skid, the yaw
STAB AUG switch must be off and the ARI circuit breaker,
on the front cockpit left sub-panel, must be pulled.</p>
<h3 id="autopilot-disengage-indicator-light"><a class="header" href="#autopilot-disengage-indicator-light">Autopilot Disengage Indicator Light</a></h3>
<p>An AUTOPILOT DISENGAGE indicator light is on the
telelight panel. After initial engagement of the AFCS
mode, the AUTOPILOT DISENGAGE indicator light and
the MASTER CAUTION light illuminates when the AFCS
is disengaged.</p>
<p>Both lights are extinguished by pressing the
master caution reset switch. The lights remain
extinguished until the AFCS is again engaged and
disengaged.</p>
<h3 id="pitch-aug-off-indicator-light"><a class="header" href="#pitch-aug-off-indicator-light">Pitch Aug Off Indicator Light</a></h3>
<p>The PITCH AUG OFF indicator light on the telelight

and the aircraft being powered.</p>
<p>Depressing the master caution reset button extinguishes the MASTER
CAUTION light. However, the PITCH AUG OFF light
remains illuminated until the Pitch STAB AUG switch is engaged.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-pitch-trim"><a class="header" href="#automatic-pitch-trim">Automatic Pitch Trim</a></h3>
<p>An automatic pitch-trim feature is included in the AFCS
which attempts to keep the airplane longitudinally
trimmed to the flight conditions experienced while in
AFCS mode.</p>
<p>Thus, an out-of-trim condition (which would
not be sensed while in autopilot mode) is prevented,
ensuring against an excessive pitch transient when
disengaging the autopilot.</p>
<p>The automatic pitch trim
operates at approximately 40% the speed of the normal
trim system, resulting in a slight delay after changing
flight conditions before the basic airplane is properly
trimmed. During control stick steering maneuvering, the
auto-trim is inoperative. Auto-trim operation can be
observed on the pitch trim indicator after changing flight
conditions in the AFCS mode.</p>
<h3 id="autopilot-pitch-trim-light"><a class="header" href="#autopilot-pitch-trim-light">Autopilot Pitch Trim Light</a></h3>
<p>The AUTOPILOT PITCH TRIM indicator light on the

<h3 id="operational-precautions"><a class="header" href="#operational-precautions">Operational Precautions</a></h3>
<h4 id="roll-reversal"><a class="header" href="#roll-reversal">Roll Reversal</a></h4>
<p>There is a possibility of a condition called roll reversal occurring when
operating the automatic flight control system in the AFCS mode. This condition
occurs infrequently and is apparent only when attempting small changes in bank
angle. Roll reversal is associated with a small out-of-trim condition in the
lateral channel, and is apparent as a slow rolling of the airplane in the
opposite direction of the stick force. If, for instance, the airplane is out of
trim laterally to the left when the AFCS mode is engaged, roll reversal may occur
when right stick forces are applied. A roll reversal situation may be caused by
operating the manual lateral trim button while in the AFCS mode, followed by
small stick forces being applied opposite to the direction of the trim. There is
a possibility of roll reversal occurring even if the airplane has been trimmed
prior to engaging the AFCS mode, and the manual trim button has not been touched.
This condition is caused by changes in airplane trim accompanying changed flight
conditions. In view of the above, the following instructions should be observed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trim airplane in stability augmentation mode before engaging AFCS mode.</li>
<li>Do not operate manual lateral trim while the AFCS mode is engaged. If roll
reversal is encountered due to change in flight condition; disengage roll,
retrim, then reengage.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pitch-oscilattions"><a class="header" href="#pitch-oscilattions">Pitch oscilattions</a></h4>
<p>When using the altitude hold mode, the aircraft may experience pitch oscillations
in the transonic regions due to fluctuations in the air data computer airspeed
system. The nature of these oscillations vary from stick pumping to divergent pitch
oscillations. It is recommended that if pitch oscillations occur at transonic speeds,
the following corrective steps be attempted:</p>
<ol>
<li>AFCS switch – DISENGAGE</li>
<li>Static pressure compensator switch – OFF</li>
<li>AFCS switch – ENGAGE</li>
<li>Engage altitude hold mode</li>
</ol>
<p>If the oscillations persist after the above action, or if they are encountered at supersonic speeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disengage altitude hold mode.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Divergent pitch oscillations should not be allowed to develop.
If any divergent pitch activity is noted, corrective action should be taken
immediately.</p>

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ext_slats_and_flaps.jpg" alt="ext_slats_and_flaps" /></p>
<p>The Slats Flap system is manually selected for takeoff and landing, then
automatically controlled relative to AoA for best handling performance in all
other flight regimes. Control is through
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three position switch</a> found
outboard of the left <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#throttles">throttle</a>

The <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three switch positions</a> are
Norm, Out, and Out and Down, and the resulting command can be moderated based on whether or not the
landing gear is being deployed.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/SlatsRelative.jpg" alt="SlatsRelative" /></p>
<p>Norm is the standard in-flight position, locking the Flaps and automatically
programming the Slat deployment as a function of AoA.</p>
<p>Out deploys the Slats to their fully deployed position. Should the landing gear
be deployed, both the Slats and Flaps will deploy.</p>
<p>Out and Down fully deploys both the Slats and the Flaps. Should the landing gear
not be down, the Wheels Light on
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight</a> Panel will
illuminate and flash.</p>
<p>Both cockpits have
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_sub_panel.html#slatsflaps-indicators">Slats Flap Indicator</a>, which read In
and Out, along with a
barber-pole reading when the surfaces are in transition.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_slats_flaps_indicator.jpg" alt="SltFlpInd" /></p>
<p>In the Norm position, Maneuvering Slat deployment is a function of AoA; above
11.5 units they will extend, then retract when the aircraft is reduced below
10.5 units. Maneuvering Slat operation includes a speed-induced blowback; slats
will retract due to air pressure between 568 and 602 knots.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_slats_override_switch.jpg" alt="Slats Override" /></p>
<p>To the rear of the Fuel Control Panel in the front cockpit is the Slat Override Switch. Guarded,
this switch has two positions: NORM and IN. Defaulted to NORM under the guard, switching to IN
forces the retraction of the slats, no matter the current aircraft AoA or state of the Slats Flap
Switch position; this action will trigger the SLATS IN warning on

<p>To precisely monitor and control aircraft flight performance, the Angle of
Attack System (AoA) provides visual and audio confirmation of current
parameters. Included in the system are the Angle of Attack Indicators found in
both cockpits, the illuminated Angle of Attack Indexers, as well as the AoA
Aural Tone System.</p>
<p>The angle of attack is typically measured in degrees (°). It represents the deviation from the
alignment of the chord line of the airplane with the oncoming air or relative wind.</p>
<h3 id="indicators"><a class="header" href="#indicators">Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_angle_of_attack_indicator.jpg" alt="AoAInd" /></p>
<p>The Angle of Attack Indicator dials register AoA values from 0 to 30 units, with
indications for weight-relative optimum altitude cruise (7.9 units), approach
(19.2 units), and stall (30 units).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The AoA Indexers are only lit with the right gear down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AoA units do not directly translate to degrees, one unit of AoA is
the same as roughly 0.95 degrees and the measured AoA is also offset
by about 4 degrees. This way, the indicator displays a more natural and useful
value to the crew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Extension of the landing gear and thus the nose
gear door changes the airflow around the probe causing to indicate higher
angles by 1 unit. The approach airspeeds account for that. Therefore, performing
an approach with the gear retracted, will cause the indicators to show
approximately 1 unit low, and the aircraft will be roughly 5 knots fast for an
on-speed approach.</p>

<h3 id="indexers"><a class="header" href="#indexers">Indexers</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_overhead_aoa_indexer.jpg" alt="AoA" /></p>
<p>The AoA Indexers, found on the windshield frame of the front cockpit, and above

<p>The Aural Tone System provides audible feedback in maneuvering flight and during
landing configuration. Beginning above 15 units AoA with gear down, and 21 units
AoA with the gear up and slats in, a pulse will be heard by both crew-members.</p>
<p>The rate of the pulse can vary from 1.5 to 20 pulses per second, with increasing
frequency based on higher AoA values.</p>
<p>This tone can be lowered in volume below 20.3 units AoA gear down/25 units gear
up with controls in each cockpit; exceeding these values will cause the system
to override the volume limits and deliver the warning pulses at a minimum
volume to ensure they are audible regardless of volume setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The respective knobs are labelled STALL WARNING and can be found on the right
side in either cockpit. They must not to be confused with the AURAL TONE CONTROL
knobs, which control weapon related tones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to limited forward visibility, the tones are a crucial aid during landing.
If a low pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too fast.
If a high pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too slow.
For the proper on-speed configuration, a steady tone at a medium pitch is played.</p>
<h2 id="stall-warning-vibrator"><a class="header" href="#stall-warning-vibrator">Stall Warning Vibrator</a></h2>
<p>The left front cockpit pedal includes a Stall Warning Vibrator, which is
activated over 22.3 units Angle of Attack. This physical (and in DCS audible)
indication is given to make the pilot aware of the potential of an impending
stall and provide enough time to reduce AoA and prevent the loss of control of
the aircraft. Reducing AoA below the threshold will deactivate the warning.</p>

<p>The F-4 Phantom uses a conventional tricycle landing gear arrangement, driven by
the Utility hydraulic system. The Landing gear is electronically controlled and hydraulically
actuated by the utility hydraulic system. Accidential retraction of the landing gear when the

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_nose_gear_steering.jpg" alt="pilot_nose_gear_steering_button" /></p>
<p>Nose Gear Steering (NGS or also NWS) is actuated using the referenced button on the control stick
in either cockpit. Holding the button down permits the crew member to steer the
aircraft using the rudder pedals. Steering limit of the nose gear is 70 degrees from
centerline in both directions.</p>
<p>Rudder steering becomes effective at approximately 70 knots. At this
speed Nose Gear Steering should be disengaged and not be used any further.</p>
<h2 id="wheel-brakes"><a class="header" href="#wheel-brakes">Wheel Brakes</a></h2>
<p>Differential steering is provided with weight on wheels using rudder pedal
deflection. Assistance in braking performance is provided by an included
Anti-Skid System, which engages with the aircraft over 30 knots. Braking
function is delayed by the Anti-Skid System on landing until the right main gear
has been in contact with the ground for 3 seconds, or the wheels reach 50 knots
of rotational speed.</p>
<h2 id="anti-skid-system"><a class="header" href="#anti-skid-system">Anti-Skid System</a></h2>
<p>The electronically controlled anti-skid system
provides anti-skid protection at wheel speeds over 30 knots. The system detects the start of a skid
and releases the brake pressure in proportion to skid severity. Below 30 knots the anti-skid
protection is not available and braking is in direct proportion to the brake pedal movement. The
system has a built-in touchdown protection feature that prevents braking until 3 seconds after
weight is sensed on the right main gear or wheel spin up to 50 knots. It should be noted that a low
coefficient of friction between the runway and tires (as it occurs during Aquaplaning or on icy
runways) may lead to the wheels not spinning up or cause them to slow below 30 knots wheel speed
after spin-up. In this case the system falsely detects the aircraft speed below 30 knots and reverts
to manual braking.</p>

<p>In the event of a Utility hydraulic system failure, emergency differential
braking is provided by pulling the Emergency Brake Handle on the lower left side
of the instrument panel in either cockpit. Doing so forces hydraulic pressure
from a reserve accumulator, and provides enough power for approximately 10 brake

<p>The Phantom carries a retractable arresting hook for ground stopping in
emergency takeoff and landing situations that will reach the strip overrun.
Placing the Arresting Hook Handle in the front cockpit into the DOWN position
will lower the hook in approximately five seconds. Lowering the hook will
illuminate a red warning lamp in the Hook Handle, and illuminate the HOOK DOWN

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_drag_chute_handle.jpg" alt="DragChuteHandle" /></p>
<p>The F-4E has an available Drag Chute to reduce landing roll as necessary. The
chute can also be used for spin recovery. Deployment of the chute is performed
by rotating the handle found in the front cockpit. The chute is drawn from its
door with a smaller pilot chute. Once the chute has deployed and performed
sufficient braking action or the aircraft has recovered into a controllable
state, the chute is jettisoned by pressing the button and pulling the handle
back, then lowering it. This action releases the chute cables and allows it to
pull free.</p>
<p>Do not use the Chute in excess of 200 Knots IAS while landing.</p>
<p>For spin recovery the Chute can be used by pushing the stick full forward, putting ailerons and
rudder in a neutral position and deploying the chute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Drag chute should not be dropped on the runway or a taxiway.
A popular technique is to leave it on the side of a taxiway
by appropriately orienting the aircraft, inflating the chute
with the engines and then releasing it in the desired direction.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom is powered by two J79-GE-17 engines built by General Electric,
with a rated static sea-level power delivery of 11,870 pounds of thrust in Mil,
and 17,900 pounds in afterburner. The engines have provision for both assisted

<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_fuel_flow.jpg" alt="FFI" /></p>
<p>Each engine has a fuel flow indicator found in the front cockpit instrument.</p>
<p>The indicators read in thousands
of pounds per hour, from 0 to 12. The indicators provide flow rate up to Mil power; when afterburner
is engaged, a separate fuel delivery system is used to provide fuel directly to the
afterburner stage, and the flow rate is approximately 4 times the value shown. The engine
speed is also controlled by the fuel flow, so a change in fuel flow can be directly observed if the
throttles are moved.</p>
<p>Fuel Flow should not exceed 1200 pph at lightoff and 800 to 1500 pph at idle operations. Fuel
consumption for Engine start is approximately 65 pounds per Engine.</p>
<h2 id="oil-system"><a class="header" href="#oil-system">Oil System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/manual_engine_oil_system.jpg" alt="manual_engine_oil_system" /></p>
<p>Each engine is equipped with a completely self-contained, dry sump, full pressure oil system. The
oil supply to the lubrication system is interrupted during negative G-flight due to the inability of
the scavenge pumps to recover oil from the sumps and gear boxes. The Engine Oil system is used for
lubrication, variable nozzle positioning and constant speed drive unit operation. The standpipes
which supply the three systems utilizing engine oil are in the reservoir such that the pipe for the
constant speed drive unit is the highest, the one for the nozzle control is the next highest, and
the lubricating system pipe is the lowest. This arrangement is to prevent a critical system failure
if one of the circuits leak. If a leak in the constant speed drive unit would occur it will probably
cause a failure of that system only, while a leak in the nozzle control system may cause failure of
that system and the constant speed drive unit. Oil is also supplied directly from the reservoir to
the constant speed drive unit, where it is used as both the control and final drive medium for
controlling generator speed. The lubrication element of the oil pump supplies oil to cool and
lubricate bearings, gears and other rubbing or moving parts in the engine. Lubricating oil is also
circulated through the engine-driven generator for cooling purposes.</p>

<p>Oil pressure indicators are on the front cockpit pedestal panel, and calibrated from 0 to 100 PSI.
Important values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 psi - Minimum at idle RPM</li>

<h2 id="variable-duct-ramp"><a class="header" href="#variable-duct-ramp">Variable Duct Ramp</a></h2>
<p>Optimization of air to the engines is performed by a Variable Duct Ramp system

<p>The -17E/G engine is equipped with one 28 volt, low energy ignition unit and one 28 volt high energy
unit that improves ground starts in cold weather and air starts using alternate fuel. The main
ignition system produces an electrical arc which ignites the atomized fuel-air mixture in the fourth
and fifth combustion chambers. The remaining eight combustion chambers are ignited through the
crossfire tubes. Pressing the ignition button causes the spark plugs to discharge, igniting the
fuel-air mixture as the throttle is moved from OFF to IDLE during engine start. The spark plugs only
fire while the spring-loaded ignition button is held.</p>
<h3 id="afterburner-ignition-system"><a class="header" href="#afterburner-ignition-system">Afterburner Ignition System</a></h3>
<p>The afterburner ignition system consists of the torch igniter, a spark plug and an afterburner

switch closes, and the spark plug supplies a continuous arc. Ignition and torch igniter fuel flow
are maintained until the throttle is removed from the afterburner detent.</p>

<p>Using
the Anti-Icing Switch
set to DE-ICE, bleed air from stage 17 is distributed to ports installed in the compressor face area
of the engines. This system does not perform de-icing functions, but is to be activated prior to ice
formation. As high Mach speeds provide enough friction heat to the air stream to deny icing in the
compressor stage, usage of the Anti-Icing System is unnecessary and can cause engine damage.</p>
<p>The system should be turned on in turbulent air and thunderstorms, or when a rise in Exhaust Gas
temperature is noted by the pilot as this is an indication for an engine icing condition.</p>
<h3 id="anti-ice-indicator-lights"><a class="header" href="#anti-ice-indicator-lights">Anti-Ice Indicator Lights</a></h3>

<p>Activation of the Anti-Icing system will illuminate two lights on the telelight panel, L ANTI-ICE On
and R ANTI-ICE On. A failure of the anti-icing system with the Anti-Icing Switch set to NORMAL will
also light these telelight indicators as a warning. If the aircraft is above Mach 1.2 when this
occurs, immediate speed reduction is necessary to prevent engine loss. Because of the warning
function for the ANTI-ICE ON lamps, a condition that illuminates them will
provide a MASTER CAUTION warning.</p>

<h3 id="exhaust-nozzle-control-unit"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-nozzle-control-unit">Exhaust Nozzle Control Unit</a></h3>
<p>Throttle position, nozzle position feedback and exhaust gas temperature are utilized to schedule the
correct nozzle area. During engine operation in the sub-mil region, the nozzle area is primarily a
function of throttle angle and nozzle position feedback. The nozzle is scheduled to approximately
7/8th open at idle and the area is decreased as the throttle is advanced toward the military power
position. However, during a rapid throttle burst from below 79% rpm to 98% rpm, a control alternator
supplies engine speed information to the temperature amplifier, which in turn schedules engine speed
inputs as a function of temperature limiting. This signal prevents the primary nozzle from closing
beyond a preset position, permitting a rapid increase in engine rpm that could damage the engine.
During engine operation in the military and afterburner region, it becomes necessary to limit the
nozzle schedule as established by the throttle angle and nozzle feedback to prohibit exhaust gas
temperature from exceeding engine design limits and damaging the engine.</p>
<h3 id="exhaust-nozzle-position-indicators-1"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-nozzle-position-indicators-1">Exhaust Nozzle Position Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_nozzle_position.jpg" alt="NPI" /></p>
<p>Directed by the Exhaust Nozzle Control Unit, the paired primary (the convergent,
inner nozzle) and secondary (the divergent, outer nozzle) are actuated
independently on a schedule to maximize outlet performance versus exhaust gas
temperature. When idle, the engine nozzle will be roughly 7/8ths open, reducing
in size as the throttle approaches MIL. During operation in the MIL and AB
regions, the Control Unit moderates the nozzle size relative to throttle
position and received EGT to maintain temperatures within design limit.</p>
<p>To monitor the current position of the nozzles relative to each other, as well
as EGTs, an indicator
is provided with calibrations from CLOSE to OPEN in four increments. The nozzle indicators enable
the pilot to make a comparison of nozzle position between engines and are also used to establish a
relationship between nozzle position and exhaust gas temperature, as well as nozzle position and
throttle settings.</p>
<p>Normal settings would be OPEN with the engines off until IDLE, 3/4 to 1/2 with
engines in IDLE and 1/4 for MIL power. MAX power will not change the indicator.</p>

<p>A pair of two-position Engine Master Switches are found on the front cockpit left console on
the inboard engine control panel. Selecting ON powers the fuel boost and transfer pumps for the
respective engine; this will occur whether the aircraft is connected to external auxiliary power or
not, as doing so without will connect the aircraft battery to the pump circuits.</p>
<p>As the Engine Master Switches arm the fuel shutoff valves, to properly shut down the engines without
external power it is necessary to return the throttles to the cutoff position prior to turning
the Engine Master Switches off, otherwise the valves will remain open.</p>
<h3 id="throttles-2"><a class="header" href="#throttles-2">Throttles</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_throttle.jpg" alt="Throttles" /></p>
<p>Paired throttles are provided in both cockpits for engine thrust control. In normal use, movement of
the throttles from IDLE to OFF will perform fuel cutoff; to prevent inadvertent engine shutdown, a
pair of finger lifts (<num>3</num>) are provided to lock out the OFF position without performing this
actuation. Afterburner is attained by shifting the throttles outboard (left) at the MIL stop, then
pushing them forward.</p>
<p>The rear cockpit throttles are connected to the front throttles in such a fashion that only the
pilot can start the engines or enter the afterburner range; the WSO can reduce throttles out
of the afterburner region back into MIL operation and lower. While the rear throttles can be shifted
from OFF without pilot assistance, return to OFF for shutdown requires pilot engagement of the
finger lifts.</p>
<p>In the event of opposing commands on the throttle arms between seats, the rear
throttles will be disconnected from the front throttles to prevent damage to
the linkage. This condition may cause a reduction in afterburner authority from the front throttle
pair. Resetting the throttle linkage is performed by placing the front throttles at the IDLE or MIL
stop and moving the rear throttles in the opposite direction to which the disconnect occurred.</p>
<p>The rear throttles only hold a microphone button and speed brake switch.</p>
<h3 id="tachometers-2"><a class="header" href="#tachometers-2">Tachometers</a></h3>

<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_egt.jpg" alt="EGT" /></p>
<p>Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicators are found on the front cockpit instrument panel.
The indicators have two pointers each: a large pointer for the 0 to 12 scale referencing 100 degrees
centigrade, and a smaller pointer on a separate scale with 0 to 10 referencing 10 degrees
centigrade. Measuring for these values is performed upon exit of the turbine. For normal operations
the exhaust gas temperature should not be less than 250°C and should not exceed more than 540°C. If
an overtemperature Event occurs the throttle should be returned to the off position. If that is not
possible the respective engine master switch should be turned off.</p>

same set of fuel cells. Internal fuselage fuel between all 7 cells and the wing
tanks is just over 12,000 lbs of JP-4. With two external 370 gallon wing tanks,
that value increases to over 16,800 lbs. Adding the centerline 600 gallon tank

<p>The F-4 carries two internal wing tanks, along with seven fuel cells down the
length of the fuselage, with cell 1 resting just behind the aft cockpit, and the
remaining cells numbered in order to the rear of the aircraft. Cell 1 is the
feed cell for the engines; cells 4 and 6 each carry a hydraulic and an electric
transfer pump to supply fuel to cells 1 and 2. The remaining fuselage cells
perform a gravity feed into cells 1, 4, or 6. Cell 2 feeds cell 1, cell 3 feeds
cell 4; and cell 5, as well as cell 7 feed cell 6. With this arrangement, center
of gravity balance is maintained along the centerline. Cell 7 is the last cell
to initiate transfer in the sequence, and does not begin until the total fuel in
cells 1 and 2 fall below 1800 lbs.</p>
<p>Fuel transfer from the wing and external tanks is performed by bleed air
pressurization once airborne. Internal wing tank fuel is transferred into
fuselage cells 1 and 3, whereas fuel from external tanks are balanced between
cells 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Internal wing and external tanks will not transfer when not pressurized.
This is the case with either the gear out or the AAR door open.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the aircraft reaches a low fuel state automatic fuel transfer activates,
forcing valves from internal wing and external tanks open regardless of what has
been selected on the panel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Automatic fuel transfer, once activated, can only be deactivated again by
cycling the Air Refuel Switch. This is important, as most switches on the fuel

<blockquote>
<p>💡 The system has no awareness of actual external tanks being loaded. The

<p>For air-to-air refueling, the F-4E uses a receptacle system compatible with high
pressure USAF-style boom refueling. With this system, fuel can be delivered to
the Phantom at a rate of up to 3900 lbs per minute. Fuel received is delivered
into fuselage cell 2, then equalized through the rest of the aircraft cells,
wing tanks, and, if installed and selected, external tanks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 While the maximal supported refuel rate is about 3900 lbs per minute, the
actual rate in practice is highly dynamic and depends on the tanks that can
still take fuel. Refuel Rate is bottlenecked by the pipe layout and their
dimensions. For example, being down to just the left and right external tank
will rather result in a refuel rate of 1400 lbs per minute. Refueling internal
tanks 1-7 takes about one to two minutes. Also filling up the wing tanks and
external tanks will take additional four to five minutes.</p>

<h3 id="air-refuel-switch"><a class="header" href="#air-refuel-switch">Air Refuel Switch</a></h3>
<p>Preparation for air refueling is performed by toggling the Air Refuel Switch
(<num>4</num>) to EXTEND; doing so extends the receptacle, illuminates the
receptacle visual lamps, depressurizes the fuel cells, activates the transfer
pumps to redistribute received fuel for CG maintenance, and activates the air
refuel READY lamp. RETRACT is used to lower the receptacle and return
pressurization and normal function to the tanks.</p>
<p>If, during AAR, the boom disconnects and the DISENGAGED light illuminates, this
switch has to be flipped to RETRACT and back to EXTEND to reset the system and
allow the boom to connect again.</p>
<h3 id="refuel-selection-switch"><a class="header" href="#refuel-selection-switch">Refuel Selection Switch</a></h3>
<p>The two-position Refuel Selection Switch (<num>3</num>) provides options for two

<p>With the receptacle extended and tanks depressurized, the READY lamp illuminates
to notify the pilot refueling can begin. The lamp will turn off when the boom is
connected to the receptacle, or the receptacle is lowered by the RETRACT command
on the Air Refuel Switch.</p>
<h3 id="disengaged-light"><a class="header" href="#disengaged-light">Disengaged Light</a></h3>
<p>Should the boom separate from the receptacle, the DISENGAGED lamp will

<p>On the front seat control stick is the Air Refueling Release Button. Its primary
purpose is to release the receptacle from the boom in the event of a manual
refueling cycle (one in which the boom operator cannot force a disconnect
remotely), or perform a disengagement on demand based on flight conditions or
emergency situation. Pressing the button will disengage the boom, and illuminate
the DISENGAGED lamp.</p>

<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_fuel_dump_switch.jpg" alt="InternalWingFuelDump" /></p>
<p>This switch, when selected to DUMP, will release fuel from the internal wing
tanks at their dump lines at the wing fold trailing edge. Flow rate is dependent
on power setting and attitude, higher engine RPM and positive pitch increases
dump speed, whereas lower RPM and a nose low condition reduces dump speed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In level flight at 85% RPM, the dump flow rate is roughly 650 pounds per
minute. Leading to the entire fuel being dumped after roughly 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="fuel-venting-system"><a class="header" href="#fuel-venting-system">Fuel Venting System</a></h2>
<p>To prevent issues with overpressure, the aircraft provides a venting system.</p>
<p>Should an overpressure condition occur, tanks will vent fuel until the pressure
is corrected.</p>
<p>The process is fully automated. External wing tanks vent through the fuel dump
system, while all other cells are connected to the vent mast below the rudder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Under normal conditions, overpressure only occurs momentarily whenever the
internal wing fuel tanks are pressurized and made ready for transfer. This is
the case whenever the gear is retracted or the AAR door is closed.</p>

<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_nav_function_selector.jpg" alt="pilot_nav_function_selector" /></p>
<p>Found on the front cockpit instrument panel, the Navigation Function Selector Panel has two knobs -
a Bearing/Distance Selector Knob and a Mode Selector Knob.
Stacked on the Mode Selector Knob is the Flight Director Switch.</p>
<h3 id="bearing-distance-selector-knob-brgdist"><a class="header" href="#bearing-distance-selector-knob-brgdist">Bearing Distance Selector Knob (BRG/DIST)</a></h3>
<p>The Bearing Distance Selector Knob (<num>1</num>) sets the bearing pointer and range indication
displays on the HSI.
Positions are VOR/TAC, TAC, ADF/TAC, and NAV COMP.</p>
<p>In VOR/TAC mode, magnetic and relative bearing to the <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR</a>
station and range to the <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a> station are provided on
the <a href="systems/nav_com/../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#horizontal-situation-indicator">HSI</a> bearing

<p>With TAC mode, magnetic and relative bearing and range to the selected TACAN
station are displayed.</p>
<p>In ADF/TAC mode, magnetic and relative bearing to the selected ADF station and
range to the TACAN station are displayed.</p>
<p>And in NAV COMP mode, magnetic and relative bearing and range are provided to
the destination set in the navigation computer.</p>
<h3 id="mode-selector-knob-mode-and-flight-director-switch"><a class="header" href="#mode-selector-knob-mode-and-flight-director-switch">Mode Selector Knob (MODE) and Flight Director Switch</a></h3>
<p>The Mode Selector Knob (<num>3</num>) controls the remaining informational displays on
the HSI (outer knob), as well as the pitch and bank steering bars on the ADI (inner knob
(<num>2</num>)
labelled FD). The mode selector knob operates independently of the bearing pointer and range
indicator, and the selector positions are <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR/ILS</a>, <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TAC</a>, NAV COMP, and HDG.
Navigation modes set by this knob will be indicated by an illuminated word message when the
instrument panel lights are on; available mode word messages are TAC (TACAN), NAV
(navigation computer), <a href="systems/nav_com/uhf.html">UHF</a> (ADF), MAN (HDG entry), ILS (instrument landing
system), and TGT (target). TGT illuminates that the WSO has provided a target
entry and pressed TGT on the Cursor Control Panel.</p>
<p>The Flight Director Switch toggles the Flight Director Computer pitch
and bank angle steering clues, visible on
the <a href="systems/nav_com/../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>. Selecting OFF
removes these bars from view.</p>
<p>In VOR/ILS, if a VOR frequency is selected,
the HSI Course Set knob is used to set the VOR radial. Once
set, the HSI Deviation Indicator shows current deviation from the selected course.
If an ILS frequency was selected, the localizer signal will be shown on the deviation indicator.</p>
<p>TACAN mode presents navigation information to the currently selected TACAN
beacon.
To provide full information, the Bearing/Distance Switch should be set to TAC.
The HSI course arrow and course selector window are set using the Course Set knob to
the desired TACAN course. Once set, the HSI Deviation Indicator and aircraft symbol
provide the top-down display relative to the set course, with a maximum
deviation deflection of ±5 degrees. The HSI Heading Set knob is used to set a
desired TACAN course for bank steering presentation on the ADI. As the bank steering
is based on the heading marker position, if it is not set properly, bank steering on the ADI will
not be correct to intercept the desired course. A To-From indicator displays when the mode selector
is in TACAN or VOR/ILS mode when either are tuned and received; once the
course is intercepted, the indication references whether the current course is taking the
aircraft to or from the tuned station.</p>
<p>The NAV COMP Mode displays magnetic ground track on the HSI course arrow and the HSI course
selector window relative to the current navigation computer fix. The ADI bank
steering bar provides steering information to direct an approach to the command
heading.</p>
<p>With HDG mode active, the HSI course arrow and deviation are slaved to the lubber
line and aircraft magnetic heading. The HSI course selector window displays the
current selected magnetic heading, which is adjusted using the Heading Set knob.
The given course information is applied for
an ADI bank steering command.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-situation-indicator-hsi"><a class="header" href="#horizontal-situation-indicator-hsi">Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)</a></h2>

<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/hsi.jpg" alt="HSI" /></p>
<p>The Horizontal Situation Indicator displays a top-down plan view of current
navigation, with cues provided relative to the selected navigation mode selector
position. It interacts closely with several navigational aids like VOR, TACAN, ADF,
and the aircraft's Navigation Computer (NAV COMP).</p>
<p>The Bearing Pointer and Range Indicator (<num>2</num>) on the HSI display the bearing and distance
to the navigation aid selected via the Bearing Distance Selector Knob.
The Navigation Mode Selector governs the functionality of the heading marker,
course arrow, and the course deviation indicator (<num>6</num>), which includes a to-from arrow.
Both these controls – the Bearing Distance Selector and the Navigation Mode Selector – have
a direct impact on the illumination of specific mode indicator lights on the HSI.</p>
<p>The compass card (<num>5</num>) in the HSI is driven by heading input from the AJB-7 system. It
rotates
to align the aircraft's magnetic heading directly under the lubber line at the top of the
instrument, assuming the signal received is accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>The Bearing pointer indicates magnetic bearing to a given VOR, TACAN or NAV COMP station,
depending on the BRG/DIST switch selection. Providing the compass card is giving good information,
this bearing is also relative. However, if there are inaccuracies in the magnetic heading,
to navigate towards the selected destination, the aircraft should be steered not by centering
the arrow on the lubber line, but by following the heading indicated by the arrow using
the magnetic compass. If a UHF (ADF) signal is tuned, the bearing pointer consistently shows
the heading in relative terms.</p>
<p>The command heading marker provides as a desired heading reference for the Flight Director.
To obtain correct steering, the marker must be manually set in all but Nav Comp modes (then
it's automatically set). The steering clues are visible on the ADI bank steering bar.</p>
<p>The deflection of the Deviation Indicator in VOR and TACAN modes indicate the deviation of the
aircraft from the selected course (visible on the Course rollers and Course Arrow).
Is indicates how far is the aircraft off the selected track. 2.5 deg per dot, maximally
up to 5 deg.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/hsi_course_deviation.jpg" alt="Course Deviation" /></p>
<p>In ILS mode, the HSI displays deviation from the localizer signal. This indication is more precise,
as the needle is more sensitive to deviations in that mode. Notably, this reading is independent
of the selected course, providing direct feedback on the aircraft's alignment with the ILS
approach path.</p>
<h2 id="attitude-director-indicator-adi"><a class="header" href="#attitude-director-indicator-adi">Attitude Director Indicator (ADI)</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_attitude_director_indicator.jpg" alt="pilot_attitude_director_indicator" /></p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/adi_scheme.jpg" alt="ADI Scheme" /></p>
<p>The ADI provides command steering to intercept selected headings, <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a>
stations, tracks, <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR</a> radials, or navigation computer destinations. Bank
steering instruction is presented using the bank steering bar, which can
reference angles up to 35 degrees, at 90 degrees of heading deviation. Any heading errors
less than that will produce a bank correction of something less than 35 degrees. If a quick
intercept or a bank angle in excess of 35 degrees is desired, the bank steering must
be disregarded during the turn.</p>
<p>The system initiates an approximate 50-degree straight-line intercept towards the desired
track until the aircraft is within 15 degrees of it. Beyond this point, it transitions
to an asymptotic approach to align with the track. For a faster intercept, it might be necessary
to disregard the bank steering signal.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/bank_steering_intercept.jpg" alt="Bank Steering Intercept" /></p>
<p>When the Heading Set knob has been used to enter the correct target heading, the
intercept presentation is accurate within a 60 degree field of a TACAN course,
or 90 degrees for a VOR radial. Additionally, a Glide-slope Pointer is provided
for relative glide-slope position indication during an ILS approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The Heading Marker must be manually aligned with the desired heading (except in NAV COMP mode)
to ensure correct bank steering guidance. However, due to wind drift, this bank steering
may not always keep the aircraft precisely on a TACAN or VOR track. In such scenarios,
manual adjustments for wind correction are required for the Heading Marker setting to maintain
the correct course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon startup of the ADI, an OFF warning flag will be displayed until the AN/AJB-7 gyro has aligned.
This can also appear due to power loss or a signal failure. The flag does not present if a system
failure occurs outside of the AN/AJB-7.</p>
<h2 id="bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi-1"><a class="header" href="#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi-1">Bearing Distance Heading Indicator (BDHI)</a></h2>

<p>The Bearing Distance Heading Indicator (BDHI)
displays navigation information using two needles, referred to as the No. 1 and No. 2 pointers,
which receive inputs controlled by the WSO Navigation Mode Selector Switch.</p>
<p>When the upper position is selected to <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a>/ADF/UHF, the no. 1 pointer
indicates UHF bearing, and the no. 2 pointer indicates the TACAN bearing. If
there is no TACAN signal, both pointers indicate the ADF bearing.</p>
<p>With the middle position selected - <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR</a>/TAC, the no. 1 pointer indicates
the VOR bearing, the no. 2 pointer indicates the TACAN bearing, and the range indicator
(<num>3</num>)
provides distance to the TACAN station. In the absence of a TACAN signal,
both pointers indicate the VOR station.</p>
<p>In the lower position, NAV COMP, the no. 1 pointer indicates bearing to the
navigation computer target coordinates, and the no. 2 pointer indicates magnetic
ground track. The range indicator notes distance to the target coordinates.</p>

<h2 id="inertial-measurement-platform"><a class="header" href="#inertial-measurement-platform">Inertial Measurement Platform</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_ins_panel.jpg" alt="wso_inertial_system_panel" /></p>
<p>The system uses a four gimbal (outer roll, pitch, inner roll, azimuth) inertial
navigating platform, with the dual roll gimbals providing redundancy to
eliminate a gimbal lock in outer roll/azimuth gimbal alignment.</p>
<p>Installed on the platform are a pair of G-200 two-axis gyros, with the upper
gyro axis aligned for spin on the north-south axis while the lower gyro aligns
for east-west spin; torque detection in each gyro tracks the perpendicular axes -
ergo, the high gyro   detects east/west rotation, while the low gyro detects
north/south rotation. In this way, rotation in all three dimensions are
represented. The gyros are floated, and proper operation can only take place
once the fluid has attained operating temperature (160 degrees F); the system is
effectively temperature controlled across the altitude operating range of the
Phantom. A series of precision magnetic torquers provide localization movement,
while acceleration pick-offs function within a separate electromagnetic field
perform the actual data capture from the displacements of the gyroscopes.</p>
<p>Along the platform, set orthogonally (at 90 degree respective positions) are a
trio of A-200D accelerometers. These accelerators, similarly floated to the
gyros, with a similar arrangement of torquers and displacement pickers to
provide velocity capture. Increasing the accuracy of these evaluations is the
inclusion of a tuning fork, the resonance from which eliminates effectively all
static friction in the motion capture assembly.</p>

<h2 id="navigational-computer-and-output-signal-distribution"><a class="header" href="#navigational-computer-and-output-signal-distribution">Navigational Computer and Output Signal Distribution</a></h2>
<p>The respective captured motion signals from the gyroscopes and accelerometers
are amplified in the LN-12D navigational computer, which then performs the earth
reference integration. The LN-12D compensates for all longitudes and can
effectively track as high as 80 degrees latitude, where the mechanical
limitations of calculating tangent relative to the equator is too high for the
device.</p>
<p>The AN/ASN-63 provides information to other systems in the Phantom from the
OSDU, or Output Signal Distribution Unit. The OSDU provides ground speed,
north-south and east-west velocity, total velocity, inertially stabilized
altitude, climb angle, true inertial heading, ground track, and drift angle. The
WRCS receives inertial true heading, ground track, drift correction angle, and
drift angle for its ballistics computer. Drift angle is captured for
the <a href="systems/nav_com/../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>,

<h2 id="alignment-options"><a class="header" href="#alignment-options">Alignment Options</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/manual_ins_alignments.jpg" alt="manual_alignment_options" /></p>
<p>The LN-12 has three modes of alignment on aircraft start: BATH, Heading Memory
(HDG MEM), and Gyrocompass alignment. Prior to performing any alignment, STBY
Reference System must be selected, the Nav Computer Control Panel should be
turned to STBY and its position update switch should be selected to NORMAL. Local
magnetic variation should be entered on the variation counter, and the position
counter should be set to local latitude and longitude. Doing so will greatly
expedite gyrocompass alignment. Furthermore, alignment should not be performed with
the wings in their folded position, as the magnetic flux valve that provides
compass synchronization wil be 60 degrees outside of normal position.</p>
<p>The INS also includes an in-flight position update option, should the aircrew
note gross deviation from known location fixes.</p>
<h3 id="indications"><a class="header" href="#indications">Indications</a></h3>
<p>The INS panel features two indicator lights: HEAT (<num>4</num>) and ALIGN (<num>2</num>).</p>
<p>The HEAT light is active
in any alignment mode (including Coarse Alignment in the STBY mode), signifying that
the system is heating up. It turns off after approximately 110 seconds, indicating
that the gyros have reached the operational temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The ALIGN light, functional exclusively in the ALIGN mode, signals the completion
of alignment. A steady ALIGN light indicates that a BATH (fast) alignment has been
achieved. Provided the system has not encountered any errors and the gyros were
pre-heated in STBY mode (evidenced by the extinguished HEAT light), the system
will proceed to perform a Gyrocompass Alignment. A flashing ALIGN light signifies
the completion of either a Gyrocompass Alignment or a Heading Memory Alignment.</p>
<h3 id="best-available-true-heading"><a class="header" href="#best-available-true-heading">Best Available True Heading</a></h3>
<p>STBY position must be placed momentarily to avoid an INS no-go.
Once set to ALIGN (HEAT light may be ingnored), the ALIGN lamp will illuminate
steadily after about 75 seconds indicating BATH Alignment is ready. Once in BATH,
the INS is accurate to roughly 5 and a half nautical miles per hour CEP, although
higher inaccuracies can be seen. Once BATH is achieved, NAV mode can be selected
and the aircraft flown with the above caveat.</p>
<h3 id="heading-memory-alignment"><a class="header" href="#heading-memory-alignment">Heading Memory Alignment</a></h3>
<p>This option becomes accessible if the alignment has been previously stored and
the aircraft has remained stationary. To access it, select HDG MEM (<num>1</num>) located
beneath the red guard on the control panel before transitioning the INS knob
from OFF to ALIGN. This alignment method minimizes the alignment time, offering
a relative Circular Error Probability (CEP) at the optimal end of BATH (5.5
nautical miles), or even Gyrocompass Alignment (3 nautical miles) if the
previous alignment occurred within the last 2 hours.</p>
<p>To access the accelerated HDG MEM alignment mode, the guard must be raised and
the switch actuated up, and the INS mode switch placed to ALIGN until the ALIGN
lamp starts flashing. Then, the INS can be placed into NAV mode. If time allows,
STBY mode can be selected before going to ALIGN to allow proper heating of the
gyroscopes (which goes through the illumination/off cycle as above).</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="gyrocompass-alignment"><a class="header" href="#gyrocompass-alignment">Gyrocompass Alignment</a></h3>
<p>Maximum system precision is found by allowing the INS to perform a full
Gyro-compassing alignment. This method permits the gyros to find the most
accurate true north reference possible, but can entail substantial amounts of
time - and even greater time based on inaccurate or missing magnetic variation
setting entry prior to powering the INS on. As an example - for a one degree
compass heading error, the time to achieve maximum accuracy on the system is
approximately five minutes, which attains an accuracy of ±10 minutes of arc
alignment, giving the aforementioned 3 nautical miles of deviation per hour. The
minimum amount of time to complete a Gyro-compassing alignment once BATH or HDG
MEM level alignment is achieved is 50 additional seconds, while a normal
alignment takes around 5 minutes. If the aircraft is aligned at 70 degrees of
latitude or more, additional time should be expected.</p>
<p>To conduct Gyrocompass Alignment, it's necessary to keep the INS in STBY mode
until the HEAT light turns off. Moving to ALIGN while the lights are still on
prevents achieving full Gyrocompass Alignment, resulting in only the BATH
process being performed. The duration of the heating phase depends on the
ambient temperature. The system heats up at a rate of approximately 20°F per
minute, reaching an operational temperature of 160°F. Once the system reaches
its operating temperature, an additional 50 seconds are required until the HEAT
light extinguishes. After transitioning to ALIGN, the light will illuminate
steadily after 75 seconds, signaling the completion of the initial BATH
alignment, initiating the gyro-compassing process. Once Gyrocompass alignment
concludes, the ALIGN indicator will flash, indicating the system has achieved
full alignment. While gyro-compassing (when the align light is steadily lit), NAV
mode can be entered at any time, though optimal accuracy will only be attained
when the ALIGN indicator flashes.</p>
<p>Any other available time prior to moving the aircraft can be spent in ALIGN to
further increase system accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="in-flight-emergency-alignment"><a class="header" href="#in-flight-emergency-alignment">In-Flight Emergency Alignment</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a significant attitude error or failure of the STBY Attitude
Reference, an emergency in-flight alignment of the INS can be executed. This may be
indicated by the NAV SYS OUT LAMP illuminated. The aircraft must maintain straight
and level flight, with the Reference System Selector selector switch set to STBY. Once in this
configuration, the INS Mode Knob should be switched to OFF, then to STBY for a duration
of 15 seconds. Subsequently, after the 15-second interval, return the Mode to NAV, and
resume straight and level flight. The process of resetting the Reference Selector to PRIM
can be performed approximately after 40 seconds, although the precise alignment time is
not specified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Accuracy of the attitude in this alignment is
contingent upon how steadily the aircraft was flown during the alignment period
and subsequent alignments may be required. Following this emergency alignment,
only attitude information will be available. Velocities, position, and displays
on the navigation computer will be inaccurate and cannot be utilized for
navigation purposes and the NAV SYS OUT LAMP will illuminate.</p>

<h2 id="navigation-computer"><a class="header" href="#navigation-computer">Navigation Computer</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_nav_panel.jpg" alt="wso_navigation_computer" /></p>
<p>The ASN-46A Nav Computer is used for general navigation and tactical route
planning. The system contains both a great circle and rhumb line computational
capabilities, with the former being used for larger distance bearing
calculations (over 120 miles), and the latter for closer range accuracy. The Nav
Computer functions solely using aircraft-based instruments, ergo the INS, Air
Data Computer, and the magnetic compass; it can receive no information from the
<a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">ILS</a>, <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR</a>, or <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a> systems.</p>
<p>The system can maintain relative bearing and distance from up to two specific
waypoints at a time (identified as Target 1 and Target 2, with Target 2 being
held in memory), and this information is shown on the BDHI and ADI in real time. For data to appear
on the BDHI, the Navigation Selection Switch must be positioned in NAV COMP.</p>
<p>The computer also provides confirmation of current LN-12 precision, using a pair
of lights (<num>6</num>) marked LAT and LONG, as well as the Variation Sync Meter (<num>5</num>).
When these
lamps are off, the current displayed position coordinates are within 1 1/2 arc
minutes precision. Magnetic variation detected by way of the INS gyroscopes is
compared against the manual performed prior to INS power-up via the Magnetic
Variation Control knob, and displayed on the Variation Sync Meter (<num>5</num>). This
deviation can be corrected on the Magnetic Variation Control Knob to bring the
sync to center. Although the magnetic variation control knob has no effect on
the meter in air data mode, positive correction prior to INS loss increases the
air data mode precision.</p>
<p>The Nav Computer can function in either Inertial or Air Data mode. Both modes
provide the same outputs but the inertial mode (default) is more accurate.</p>
<p>In the event of an INS failure, the Nav Computer reverts to Air Data mode. In
Air Data mode, the rear pilot must continually monitor and adjust true wind
direction and speed, magnetic variation, as the only dead reckoning inputs
available to the computer is true airspeed (from the air data computer) and
magnetic heading from the compass system. When the system reverts to Air Data
mode, the AIR DATA MODE lamp will illuminate.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_nav_panel_air_data_light.jpg" alt="wso_nav_panel_air_data_light" /></p>
<p>During startup, the Position Control Knobs, Wind Control Knobs, and Magnetic
Variation Control Knob are used to enter known latitude, longitude, wind
direction and speed, and magnetic variation for the location of the aircraft at
that time.</p>
<h3 id="waypoint-entry"><a class="header" href="#waypoint-entry">Waypoint Entry</a></h3>
<p>Entering waypoints and target information is performed using the Function
Selector Knob and the two Target Control Knobs (<num>10</num>), one for latitude, and the other
longitude.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>OFF</td><td>System off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>STBY</td><td>System powered, but no latitude or longitude reference performed versus the values in the Target windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TARGET 1</td><td>Provides readouts of range and bearing on the currently entered Target window values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TARGET 2</td><td>Selects range and bearing information from previously stored Target window values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESET</td><td>Deletes any previously saved Target window values, stores currently entered Target window values.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Because of the Target 2 memory function, in practice the aircrew has some
flexibility in process depending on the demands of the mission. As an example,
should the Phantom crew be tasked with a CAP or defensive role relative to a
known position (ie, bullseye), the coordinates of that location can be loaded
into the Target Control values, the Function Selector placed into RESET, and
then returned to Target 2. Any change from Target 2 to Target 1 or STBY, then
back to Target 2 will maintain said location value, easily accessed. This will memorize the entered
position into Target 2, from which it will be easily accessible by just switching the knob back to
Target 2 at any time.</p>
<p>The other common technique was "leapfrogging":</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On startup, the second waypoint would be stored in Target 2 memory (entry on
the Target Control values, Function to RESET, then back to Target 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the second waypoint location was stored, the rear pilot would then
select Target 1 for live entry of the first in-flight waypoint on the Target
Control values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During flyout to the first waypoint, upon passing it over, Target 2 would be
selected as the destination, and the next waypoint (<num>3</num>) would be entered on
the Target Control Values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon flyover of waypoint 2, the Function Knob would be positioned to RESET,
then back to Target 2 - now pulling the waypoint 3 values from the Target
Control values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process would be continued over the course of the flight, and allow the
rear pilot the ability to immediately switch to Target 1 for a quick check of
relative position to another location of interest if required, or an in-flight
detour (such as to a tanker track), then return back to the next stored waypoint
for navigation.</p>
<h2 id="in-flight-updating"><a class="header" href="#in-flight-updating">In Flight Updating</a></h2>
<p>In flight updating with the Nav Computer is performed using direct overflight of
known target points, using a visual or radar fix, over a <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a> station, or via
instruction from GCI.</p>
<h3 id="inertial-mode-update"><a class="header" href="#inertial-mode-update">Inertial Mode Update</a></h3>
<p>With the Nav Computer in Inertial mode, the aircraft is flown straight and level
at a known fix location.</p>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_nav_panel_pos_update_switch.jpg" alt="wso_nav_panel_pos_update_switch" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prior to arrival at the fix point the Position Update Fix is placed in SET position. Doing
so disengages the longitude and latitude position counters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The position longitude and latitude counters are set using their respective
knobs for the known location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Directly before overflying the fix point the Position Update Switch is placed and held in the FIX
position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon direct flyover of the fix point, the Position Update Switch is released,
allowing it to fall back into NORMAL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The correction rate of the Nav Computer is roughly 3 minutes latitude or
longitude per second, and the Update Switch (<num>7</num>) must be held in FIX long enough to
account for the largest value. As an example, if the deviation is 9 minutes in
latitude and 4 in longitude, the FIX position must be held at least 3 seconds
prior to the aircraft directly passing the fix location. Further, the switch
actuation from SET to FIX must be smooth and direct, as there is a half second
time delay in the computer in the pass-through of NORMAL.</p>
<h3 id="air-data-mode-update"><a class="header" href="#air-data-mode-update">Air Data Mode Update</a></h3>
<p>In Air Data Mode, the Nav Computer can be updated as in the Inertial Mode using
the SET/FIX method, or via direct rotation of the latitude and longitude
position knobs. Using the latter method requires the Function Select Knob to be
placed in STBY, TARGET 1, or TARGET 2. The SET/FIX method is preferred, as doing
so allows for instant update upon fix position flyover and release of the
switch.</p>

<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/ext_vor_ils_beacon.jpg" alt="ext_vor_ils_beacon" /></p>
<p>The VHF omnidirectional range instrument landing system, or VOR/ILS, provides
precise bearing and course deviation information from a transmitting ground
station. Additionally, the aircraft is able to use precision landing approach
and descent capabilities at localizer equipped fields. Guidance information from
the VOR/ILS system is provided to the pilot on the BDHI, ADI, and HSI. VOR/ILS
function is enabled on these displays using the appropriate Flight Director
Group control selections on the Bearing/Distance Selector switch, the Navigation
Mode Selector switch, and the Flight Director Switch.</p>
<h2 id="ils-system"><a class="header" href="#ils-system">ILS System</a></h2>
<p>The ILS system is designed to detect deviations from the designated landing approach path
and relay this information to selected avionics in the aircraft.</p>
<p>When the appropriate ILS mode
is selected on the Navigation Function Selector Panel, several instruments provide guidance
for precision approach. These include the Deviation Indicator on the Horizontal Situation
Indicator (HSI), which shows lateral alignment with the runway, and the Glide-slope Indicator
on the ADI, which displays the vertical descent angle relative to the ideal glide path.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the Flight Director is activated, steering cues will be provided by the
needles on the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI), offering visual guidance for both pitch
and roll to maintain the correct approach path.</p>
<p>In the rear cockpit the both horizontal and
vertical deviations are presented on the Course Indicator.</p>
<p>The typical maximum deviations are ±2.5 degrees for the localizer and ±0.7 degrees
for the glide-slope.</p>
<h3 id="marker-beacons"><a class="header" href="#marker-beacons">Marker Beacons</a></h3>
<p>If Marker Beacons are positioned along the approach path, the aircraft's system will audibly

Depending on the specific setup at an airport, there can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outer Marker: Identified by a low-pitched, continuous tone.</li>
<li>Middle Marker: Recognized by a higher-pitched, alternating audio tone. This marker indicates
a closer proximity to the runway, usually at the decision altitude for landing.</li>
<li>Inner Marker: Characterized by a very high-pitched tone or a series of high-pitched dots.
This marker is not always present but, when it is, signifies an even closer position to the
runway end.</li>

<p>In DCS, to find the desired VOR/ILS frequency of your target, go on the Map and
click an airfield that you want to fly to. If available,
VOR and ILS frequencies will be listed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Not every airfield has a VOR station or an ILS systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system is designed to automatically detect whether a tuned frequency corresponds
to a VOR station or an ILS localizer. VOR operates within a frequency range of 108 MHz
to 117.95 MHz. The ILS localizer frequency range is from 108.1 MHz to 111.95 MHz.</p>
<p>In the shared frequency region, VOR stations typically operate on frequencies with
an even-numbered tenth of the range (e.g. 108.2 MHz, 108.4 MHz, etc.), while ILS localizer
frequencies are assigned to the odd-numbered tenths, including hundredths of a MHz
(e.g. 108.1 MHz, 108.3 MHz, 108.35 MHz, etc.).</p>
<p>The glide-slope component of the ILS operates in a frequency range from 329.3 MHz to 335.0 MHz.
These frequencies are paired with their corresponding localizer frequencies, ensuring
that there is no need for separate manual setting. When a localizer frequency is selected,
the associated glide-slope frequency is automatically tuned, providing integrated lateral
and vertical guidance (if available) for precision approaches.
The Marker Beacon that works in conjunction with the ILS system, operates at a frequency
of 75 MHz.</p>

and a guard receiver (at 243 MHz).
Control over these systems is facilitated by two control panels, one located in each cockpit.
The panel that is currently active assumes full command over the radio operations.</p>
<p>The COMM unit is capable of <strong>receiving and transmitting</strong> on a wide range of manually

functionality covers a frequency range from 225.0 MHz to 399.95 MHz.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
the AUX unit is designed to <strong>receive</strong> signals on 20 preset frequency channels, ranging
from 265.0 MHz to 284.9 MHz.</p>
<p>Both the COMM and AUX receivers have the capability to

<h2 id="speech-security-unit-ky-28"><a class="header" href="#speech-security-unit-ky-28">Speech Security Unit KY-28</a></h2>
<p>The UHF communication system is capable of providing either conventional or
crypto voice transmission and reception. Both UHF and intercom systems can be
used in combination with the KY-28 Speech Security Unit, if so desired in a
tactical or hostile environment. The KY-28 can either cipher outgoing voice
transmissions or decipher received voice transmissions; however, these functions
cannot be performed simultaneously. The crew can choose between plain or cipher
mode of operation. In the cipher mode operation the KY-28 converts voice inputs
through the microphone into crypto transmissions and deciphers crypto replies
that are being received to the crews headsets. In the plain mode operation the
UHF functions as a conventional voice transceiver.</p>
<h2 id="ky-28-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-controls-and-indicators">KY-28 Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_ky_28.jpg" alt="KY28Mode" /></p>
<p>The KY-28 is controlled by the KY-28 control panel and respectively the
conventional UHF or Intercom controls. Both front and rear cockpit instrument
panels display mode lights for either mode. If the mode light P is illuminated (<num>1</num>)
the KY-28 and UHF/Intercom is operated in plain mode. If the mode light C is
illuminated (<num>2</num>) the KY-28 and UHF/intercom is operated in the cipher mode.</p>
<h2 id="ky-28-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-control-panel">KY-28 Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_ky_28_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_ky_28" /></p>
<p>The KY-28 control panel is in the rear cockpit. It has a power knob, a mode switch and a code
zeroize button. The power knob (<num>3</num>) provides power to the KY-28 and can be set to either
OFF, ON or
RLY (relay). The KY-28 is not powered in the OFF position. It is powered in the ON and RLY
positions. If a direct communication between KY units is desired, the ON position is to be selected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 RLY would provide the ability to use the KY-28 as a retransmission facility,
which is not modeled in DCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mode switch (<num>2</num>) can be set to either P (plain) or C (cipher)
operating modes. To change modes the switch has to be pulled outwards. If the
KY-28 is powered and the mode switch is set to the C position, the UHF
transmitter is automatically selected for front cockpit transmissions. Pressing
the zeroize button neutralizes the preset code in the KY-28. The zeroize button (<num>1</num>)
is guarded and should only be used in emergencies or after aircraft shutdown if
required. As the code can only be set on the ground, pressing the zeroize button
during flight makes the cipher mode inoperable for the crew for the remainder of
the flight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To permit conventional UHF communications the mode must be set to P
(plain) even if the KY-28 power knob is in the OFF position. If the mode is set
to C (cipher), conventional UHF communication is inhibited in both the front and
rear cockpit. An exception to this is transmission and reception on guard or aux
receivers, as these are not affected by the cipher mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ky-28-modes-of-operation"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-modes-of-operation">KY-28 Modes of Operation</a></h2>
<p>All transmitted and received signals are routed through the KY-28 unit. When the
KY-28 mode is set to P (plain), the UHF transceiver operates in the conventional
voice manner, whether the KY-28 is powered or not.</p>
<p>To operate the UHF transceiver in the KY-28s C (cipher) mode, the KY-28 has to
be powered. When operating in the cipher mode, the KY-28 unit functions in
either standby, receive, or transmit.</p>
<p>All KY-28 units remain in the STANDBY condition until either the microphone
button is actuated or a sync preamble is received. Once transmission or
reception of the crypto message has been completed the KY-28 automatically
reverts to the standby condition. While the KY-28 is in the standby condition
the radio equipment also functions as a traditional receiver as all incoming
non-crypto transmissions are passed directly to the headsets.</p>
<p>The unit switches to the cipher RECEIVE condition whenever a sync preamble is
received. The sync preamble is generated by other KY-8, KY-28 or KY-38 units
when the transmitting stations operator actuates the microphone switch. The sync
preamble ensures that all units in the network are in the cipher receive
condition. The enciphered message is received immediately after the sync
preamble signal and the message is decoded by the KY-28 and passed to the
aircrew headsets in the form of plain language.</p>
<p>When the UHF microphone switch is set to the UHF position, the KY-28 switches to
the TRANSMIT condition. The sync preamble signal is transmitted to all receiving
KY stations to switch to the cipher receive condition. After actuating the
microphone switch, a brief tone is heard in the aircrew headsets. The tone
signal indicates that the sync preamble signal has been completed and
transmitted, after which the KY-28 is ready to transmit the crews voice input.
When the mic button is released again, the KY-28 reverts to the standby
condition. The WSO must select UHF communications with the radio selector switch
to transmit ciphered messages. The UHF transmitter is automatically selected for
front cockpit transmissions if the KY-28 is operated in mode C.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 With the C (cipher) mode selected, the transmit condition overrides the
cipher receive condition. Hence during cipher receive operation the UHF
microphone switch should not be actuated until the incoming message has been
completed.</p>

<p>The AN/APX-76 system enables regular interrogation with friendly transponder systems.</p>
<p>Further, the US reverse-engineered some Soviet transponder systems actively used between
1960 and 1980 enough to be able to develop the spoofing system AN/APX-81A <em>Combat-Tree</em>.
Combat-Tree sends compatible interrogation requests to Soviet systems which they would identify
as friendly systems, hence sending back a valid response.
This allows the Phantom to not only identify friendly systems,

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hydraulics"><a class="header" href="#hydraulics">Hydraulics</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/../img/manual_hydraulics_diagram.jpg" alt="manual_hydraulics_diagram" /></p>
<p>The hydraulic power system of the F-4E consists of three, completely
independent, closed hydraulic systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Control System 1 (PC-1)</li>
<li>Power Control System 2 (PC-2)</li>
<li>Utility System</li>
</ul>
<p>The systems have an operating pressure of approximately 3000 psi
and are pressurized any time the engines are running.</p>
<p>Ailerons, spoilers, and the stabilator have two hydraulic actuators.
The PC systems are the primary hydraulic delivery to the flight control systems,
with PC-1 powering the left side of the aircraft, and PC-2
powering the right; these supply pressure to one of the two actuators on each flight control surface.
PC-1 is using left engine pump and PC-2 is using right engine pump.</p>
<p>The Utility Hydraulic System is pressurized by a hydraulic pump on each engine. To prevent the
utility hydraulic pumps from resonating, check valves
with different operating pressures are installed on the
pump output lines. As a result, the right engine utility
hydraulic pump will deliver 2775 ±225 psi at idle rpm,
and the left engine utility hydraulic pump will deliver
approximately 3000 ±250 psi at idle rpm.
The Utility System supplies hydraulic
pressure to all aircraft systems (which need hydraulic pressure) except the stabilator actuator.
It drives the second actuator on every flight
control surface (except stabilator), acting as both a power assist and backup.</p>
<p>The first stabilator actuator is powered through PC-1 and the second one by PC-2.
Additionally on aircraft after <em>TO 1F-4-903</em>,
an Stabilator Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)
is installed to provide backup hydraulic pressure for
longitudinal control. An electrically driven hydraulic
pump pressurizes the APU system to 1700 ±100 psi. The
APU supplies pressure to the PC-1 side of the stabilator
if PC-1 pressure drops below 1000 psi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The PC-1, PC-2, and Utility hydraulic system
are independent of each other; therefore, each
aileron and spoiler has two independent sources
of hydraulic pressure and one system functions as
a backup for the other.</p>

<p>In the event of a pressure loss on PC-1 or PC-2 or the Utility system below 1500 PSI, or a detected
definite pump failure, CHK HYD GAGES will illuminate on
the telelight panel along with
the Master Caution warning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In the event of a Utility system failure on the right side, no apparent pressure loss will be
shown to underline the illumination of the CHK HYD GAGES light, whereas a left side failure will
show a loss of 200 PSI or more on the Utility system pressure indicator. In any case, if the
pressure recovers back to above 1750 PSI, the CHK HYD GAGES light will turn off. In the event of a
Utility system failure on the right side, no apparent pressure loss will display to
match the CHK HYD GAGES light, whereas a left side failure will show a loss of
200 PSI or more on the Utility system pressure indicator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a CHK HYD GAGES warning, the Master Caution can be cleared by resetting; however, be aware that
if the CHK HYD GAGES light is still on at that certain moment, a subsequent hydraulic system failure
will not re-trigger the Master Caution warning, with the consequence of not taking notice.</p>
<p>Also, the Master Caution and CHK HYD
GAGES lights can illuminate momentarily during extension of the
landing gear, or during intense maneuvering due to system load. In such situations, check the
pressure indicators: should they return to nominal values, disregard the warnings as they will reset
momentarily.</p>

<p>The pneumatic system provides high pressure air for the
normal and emergency operation of the canopies, and the
emergency operation of the landing gear and slats flaps.
Air for the pneumatic system is drawn from the engine
bleed air supply, via the electronic equipment cooling
system, and is compressed by a hydraulic motor driven air
compressor. A pneumatic pressure sensor in the system
moisture separator opens a hydraulic shutoff valve, to
activate the air compressor, when the system pressure
falls below 2750 +50 -0 psi. When the pneumatic system
pressure builds to 3100 +100 -50 psi, the pneumatic
pressure sensor closes the hydraulic shutoff valve which
de-activates the air compressor. Normal system
pressure range is from 2650 to 3300 psi due to pressure
transmitter and pressure gage tolerances.</p>
<p>The pressurized air from the air compressor is
then fed into the different tanks which can
supply it to several systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canopies</li>
<li>Landing gear (in emergency mode)</li>

<p><em>"I'll tell you what, it's got a fine radar inside, the APQ-120,
you can get a skin paint on a skeeter 200 miles, or a stealth fighter."</em></p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_dish_nose.jpg" alt="Radar Dish" />
<em>A technician works on the AN/APQ-120(V) fire control radar in the nose
of a 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing F-4E Phantom II aircraft</em></p>
<p>The Westinghouse AN/APQ-120 Fire Control Radar, a continuation of the F-4C's
-100 and the 4D's 109, is a solid state pulse radar providing the F-4E with air
to air intercept functionality, air to ground mapping, ground target reference
provision to the LABS and WRCS bombing systems, as well as radar beacon
capability. The APQ-120 also functions as the display system for TISEO and TV
guided weapon imagery, and is integrated with the
<a href="systems/radar/../identification_systems.html#interrogator-systems">APX-80 interrogation system</a>.</p>
<p>The primary conversion from the APQ-109 to APQ-120 included a reduction in the
number of field replaceable units in the nose, as well as the reduction in their
size; whereas the -109 had been a hybrid in its movement towards solid state
hardware (primarily in the low voltage processing sections), the 120 was a fully
solid-state system. While this update reduced the space overhead and weight for
the system, the modification of the F-4 nose to include the
<a href="systems/radar/../../stores/guns.html#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan">M61 cannon</a> required a
reduction in antenna size, causing a marginal decrease in overall detection
range. However, when taken with the increase in system reliability and reduced
maintenance, the tradeoff was considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Starting with production of the F-4E block 60, and retrofitted to selected
earlier block aircraft, was the addition of the Digital Scan Converter Group
display. The inclusion of DSCG increased the overall ease of handling the
APQ-120 by adding additional information on the display directly, including
current radar range setting and the calculated range rate value against the
current acquired target. Further, clarity of the display in all lighting
conditions was improved by rendering the radar reference grids directly as part
of the displayed image, rather than the previously used markings on the DVST
glass. In addition, the DSCG provided the ability of the two crew members to
utilize the displays independently; previously, the WSO had control over which
mode both the DVST and front seat repeater display would show. With DSCG, the
pilot could utilize TISEO or TV air to ground weapons while the WSO maintained a
scan pattern or found a ground reference point and inserted it into the WRCS.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_screen.jpg" alt="radar_screen" /></p>
<h2 id="principle"><a class="header" href="#principle">Principle</a></h2>
<p>The APQ-120 is a pulse radar. The radar transmits a radio pulse focused
in one direction via the antenna.</p>
<p>Any obstacle in that direction, for example another aircraft or simply ground,
will reflect part of the energy back, which the radar then receives via
the antenna to be processed and evaluated by the crew.
Based on the time it took for the signal to travel back, the radar
computes the distance to the obstacle.</p>
<p>All radar returns are then displayed on the screen <strong>based on their distance</strong>,
resulting in a <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>unfiltered</strong> representation of the world in
front of the aircraft.</p>
<p>However, since the emitter is not a perfect device, energy is transmitted into all
directions, with the main focus being the direction in which the antenna is
pointing at. This is referred to as the <strong>main lobe</strong> of the antenna, while any
other unwanted returns from different directions are called <strong>side lobes</strong>.</p>

<p>Initial powering of the APQ-120 starts by placing the Radar Power Knob into TEST
or STBY (Standby). The warmup cycle requires 3 minutes from selecting either
setting, and confirmation of this process is shown via the Control Monitor Meter
on the Monitor Panel; after 30 seconds from cycling power, the gauge will
display a value of roughly 250Vdc; from the point the needle shows power at this
nominal value, the warmup procedure will be 2.5 minutes.</p>
<p>After 3 minutes, the radar can safely be placed into OPR (Operate) for
employment of the radar, BIT testing can be performed in TEST mode, or the radar
can be left in STBY for the safety of crew and others on the ground.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency situation requiring immediate operation of the
radar, EMER can be selected; see the

<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/wso_radar_polar_switch.jpg" alt="Polarization Switch" /></p>
<p>The polarization of the radio frequency energy can be changed using the
polarization control. In normal operation the LIN setting is used which produces
linearly polarized RF energy (Radio Frequency) in the vertical direction relative to the
antenna. This
minimizes ground returns as many types of ground clutter are less reflective to
vertically polarized RF energy. However, because the antenna is not roll stabilized
increased return intensity may be seen when rolling the aircraft.</p>
<p>Both CIR 1 and CIR 2 are circularly polarized positions. Precipitation is less
reflective to circularly polarized RF, so CIR 1 and CIR 2 can aid in
minimizing clutter in rain or fog.</p>
<p>The polarization is set using the quarter waveplate in the feedhorn which causes
the <a href="systems/radar/general_operation.html#klystron">continuous wave emissions</a> to be polarized as
described above. This makes only CIR 1 compatible with launching
<a href="systems/radar/../../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7 Sparrows</a> as the
Sparrow rear antenna cannot receive counterclockwise polarized RF.</p>

<p>Voltages are confirmed beginning with the -250 position of the Selector Knob and
the Meter Switch in VOLT, and will indicate in the "1"-region of the gauge
approximately thirty seconds after radar power-on, signifying correct voltage
delivery. After this power-up, the Monitor Meter will indicate in the "1"-region
for nominal function if the voltages delivered are correct. The +35 selection is
an exception to this rule, as the value for correct function is 2.0 or greater.</p>
<p>In SIGNALS mode, the RX1-RX4 crystal current are functioning correctly with a
return in the XTAL region.</p>
<p>The EX1 and 2 test electrical frequency control crystals, and are also nominal
when XTAL is returned.</p>
<p>For the magnetron, tested in MAG, long pulse operation is confirmed with a return of
1.4 to 1.8, and short pulse operation is correct with a value of 0.9 to 1.15.</p>
<p>KLY, which tests the CW transmitter, should find a value of 0.25 to 1.25 when
radiating correctly.</p>
<p>TP 1 tests the temperature and pressure interlocks, and the monitor meter indicates 1 when

<h2 id="magnetron-and-klystron"><a class="header" href="#magnetron-and-klystron">Magnetron and Klystron</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_antenna_feedhorn.jpg" alt="Radar Antenna Feedhorn" /></p>
<p>The magnetron and klystron are the two methods for producing radio frequency
energy in the APQ-120 radar set. Both, the magnetron and klystron radiation is
fed through the antenna and emitted from the feedhorn.</p>
<h3 id="magnetron"><a class="header" href="#magnetron">Magnetron</a></h3>
<p>The magnetron is the main radio frequency emitter for the radar. It produces
pulsed energy which is used to detect and track targets.</p>
<p>Magnetron emission is only present when the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> is in OPER or EMER and all interlocks
described below are satisfied.</p>
<p>The magnetron is protected by a wave guide pressure switch and a temperature
interlock. If either of these interlocks are open (possibly because of damage or
malfunction) the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> can be moved into EMER
to return operation; however, operation of the magnetron without adequate
pressure or cooling, may damage the magnetron and can burn the feedhorn.</p>
<p>The magnetron is not powered until 3 minutes after radar is turned on. This can
be overridden by moving the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> into EMER;
however, operating the magnetron without sufficient warm up may result in
incorrect pulse width and timing and/or degraded pulse power.</p>
<h3 id="klystron"><a class="header" href="#klystron">Klystron</a></h3>
<p>The klystron produces continuous wave radio frequency energy, which is used to
tune and guide the Sparrows.</p>
<p>The klystron emissions are present when the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> is in STBY, OPER or EMER, the
<a href="systems/radar/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">Radar Missile Power Switch</a>
is in CW and all interlocks described below are satisfied.</p>
<p>The klystron is protected by two temperature switches, a pressure switch and a
surge current switch. If any of these interlocks (with the exception of the
surge current switch) are open, the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> can
be moved into EMER to return operation; however, damage to the klystron and
feedhorn may result.</p>
<p>The klystron is not powered until 100 seconds after the radar is turned on. This
can be overridden by moving the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#power">Radar Power Knob</a> into
EMER; however, operating the klystron without sufficient warm up may result in
degraded power.</p>
<h2 id="feedhorn-nutation"><a class="header" href="#feedhorn-nutation">Feedhorn Nutation</a></h2>
<p>Feedhorn nutation is required for automatic tracking. The feedhorn nutates to
rotate the radiated energy around the antenna axis. This modulates the radar
echoes. Where the echo is strongest the antenna will steer if tracking, this
drives the antenna back onto a tracked target.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this nutation is increasing the beam-width, from 3.7 degrees
(half power) to 6.7 degrees (full power) while reducing the average intensity of
the beam.</p>
<p>Below describes the nutation settings for the action switch.</p>

<h2 id="antenna-stabilization"><a class="header" href="#antenna-stabilization">Antenna Stabilization</a></h2>
<p>There are three antenna stabilization modes. Two apply to
<a href="systems/radar/air_to_air.html">Air-To-Air Operation</a> and the other to
<a href="systems/radar/air_to_ground.html">Air-To-Ground Operation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/manual_antenna_stab.jpg" alt="Antenna Stabilization" /></p>
<h3 id="nor"><a class="header" href="#nor">NOR</a></h3>
<p>Normal operation of the antenna stabilization.</p>
<p>In <a href="systems/radar/air_to_air.html#automatic-search">Automatic Search</a>, the antenna is stabilized
in pitch and roll to the horizon (radar plane). The center of the radar scan is
along the heading of the aircraft. In this mode the zero degree mark on the
display indicates the horizon.</p>
<p>In <a href="systems/radar/air_to_air.html#air-to-ground-ranging">Air-To-Ground Ranging</a>, the antenna is
boresighted to the radar boresight line but stabilized in drift.</p>
<h3 id="drift-out"><a class="header" href="#drift-out">DRIFT OUT</a></h3>
<p>The same as NOR, but drift stabilization is removed.</p>
<h3 id="stab-out"><a class="header" href="#stab-out">STAB OUT</a></h3>
<p>In <a href="systems/radar/air_to_air.html#automatic-search">Automatic Search</a> the antenna does not
stabilize to the horizon, but instead th aircraft reference.</p>
<p>With <a href="systems/radar/air_to_air.html#air-to-ground-ranging">Air-To-Ground Ranging</a>, the antenna
is boresighted to the radar boresight line without drift stabilization. In this
mode the zero degree mark on the display indicates the radar boresight line.</p>
<h2 id="pulse-setting"><a class="header" href="#pulse-setting">Pulse Setting</a></h2>
<p>The pulse setting determines several characteristics of the Radar Set. These
include the length of the transmitted pulse, which amplifier is used to amplify
the signals, the frequency at which the pulses are emitted (i.e. the pulse
repetition frequency).</p>
<p>The setting is controlled with the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#pulse-switch">Pulse Switch</a>
into either LONG or SHORT modes.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Mode</th><th>Amplifier</th><th>Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) Setting (Hz)</th><th>Pulse Length (microseconds)</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The AIR-GND and Automatic Acquisition mode force the pulse setting into

<p>The AUTO setting enables the power-level mode switching (PLMS) described below.</p>
<h3 id="power-level-mode-switching"><a class="header" href="#power-level-mode-switching">Power Level Mode Switching</a></h3>
<p>Power Level Mode Switching automatically selects the LONG or SHORT, and Narrow
Band or Back Bias amplifiers depending on several conditions such as target
range, echo strength or noise signal.</p>
<h2 id="gain-control"><a class="header" href="#gain-control">Gain Control</a></h2>
<p>The amplification of the signals that enter the receiver is called the gain. The
gain setting is important to both search and tracking operations and is the main
means for the crew to pickup targets on the display.</p>
<h3 id="manual-gain-control"><a class="header" href="#manual-gain-control">Manual Gain Control</a></h3>
<p>The gain can be altered manually. This changes how returns are displayed. Higher
gain settings amplify all echoes but can result in noise and saturation
resulting in degraded image. Lower gain settings will result in better target
contrast; however, weaker returns will not be visible, this can degrade detection
range.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Too much gain</th><th>Perfect gain (2 targets)</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</div>
<p>When the radar locks on a target, the gain control is switched to the
<a href="systems/radar/general_operation.html#automatic-gain-control">Automatic Gain Control Circuit</a> and manual gain
control no longer is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Getting the correct gain is a balance and comes with experience, as a
general rule of thumb for search the gain should be increased until a small
amount of noise (random specks) begins to show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with receiver gain the display also has image levelling, after adjusting
the gain it may take a few scans for the image to adjust the level correctly.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-gain-control"><a class="header" href="#automatic-gain-control">Automatic Gain Control</a></h3>
<p>The Automatic Gain Control takes control of the gain setting once the radar is
in track. The gain is adjusted automatically using the target within the range
tracking gate to provide a consistent target signal for tracking.</p>
<h2 id="sensitivity-time-control-stc"><a class="header" href="#sensitivity-time-control-stc">Sensitivity Time Control (STC)</a></h2>
<p>The strength of a radar echo falls off with <code>1 / r^4</code> where <strong>r</strong> is the
range. This means on a normal display the brightness of the radar returns will
get dimmer with distance.</p>
<p>For ground mapping the APQ-120 counteracts this effect. With the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#radar-modes-mode">Radar Mode Knob</a> in MAP and the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#display-knob">Display Knob</a> in a PPI mode, Sensitivity Time
Control is enabled.</p>
<p>When enabled, it exponentially increases the receiver gain with range to
counteract the echo power fall off with range. This provides an approximately
even brightness with increasing range.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="air-to-air-radar-operation"><a class="header" href="#air-to-air-radar-operation">Air to Air Radar Operation</a></h1>
<p>Radar operation for Air-To-Air includes the RDR-B and MAP-B modes, along with
the BST mode. RDR-B and MAP-B can be used with automatic search and BST mode can
be used as a close range mode to cue a target on the boresight.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-search"><a class="header" href="#automatic-search">Automatic Search</a></h2>
<p>During automatic search, the antenna moves back and forth in the radar plane.
The limits of this search are determined by the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#display-knob">Display Knob</a>. Search is normally 120 degrees wide
with the display knob in WIDE positions, and limited to 45 degrees in the NAR
position. Only Display Knob positions with B are usable in Air-To-Air
operations.</p>
<p>The <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#radar-modes-mode">Radar Mode Knob</a> knob is used to select
automatic search by choosing either RDR or MAP. In RDR the number of bars can be
selected by the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#scan-switch">Scan Switch</a>. In MAP only 1 bar is
used regardless of the switch. Feedhorn nutation is used with RDR but not MAP;
leading to an estimated beam-width of approximately 6.7 degrees in RDR and 3.7
degrees in MAP.</p>
<p>Selecting BST or AIR-GND on the Radar Mode Knob, the antenna scan is boresighted
along the radar boresight line.</p>

<p>On the top right corner of the radar screen is an
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#track-light-t">engraved T</a> symbol which illuminates if a range
track condition is present. This is only found on the WSO Screen.</p>
<h3 id="angle-track"><a class="header" href="#angle-track">Angle Track</a></h3>
<p>The Angle Tracking circuit steers the antenna to keep the target centered. It
does so by making use of feedhorn nutation (conical scan). The antenna steers
towards the direction of highest amplitude in the nutation scan pattern. As a
result, angle tracking cannot be achieved without nutation (MAP-B begins
nutation when using acquisition).</p>
<p>Angle Tracking has two settings set by the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#maneuver-switch">Maneuver Switch</a>, HI G and LOW G. These set
limits on the acceleration in the angle tracking circuits.</p>
<p>Antenna steering has several important functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking target location in elevation and azimuth</li>
<li>Providing head aiming angles to the Sparrow for a seeker lock-on.</li>
<li>Illuminating the target with continuous wave radio frequency energy for
Sparrow guidance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="range-track"><a class="header" href="#range-track">Range Track</a></h3>
<p>The radar uses a range gate to select a target in range. This uses only radar
returns within the range gate for its circuits. This helps eliminate clutter and
other targets, and allows angle tracking circuits to accurately track the target
of interest without erroneous signals.</p>
<p>In Range Track, the range gate uses the radar echoes to automatically correct
any error between the range gate and the target echo. This causes the range gate
to move; the rate at which the gate moves is the closure velocity and displayed
on the screen. This is also used to supply the Sparrow with a closure velocity
to set its speed-gate for target tracking.</p>
<p>Range Track can operate in memory mode. When in memory mode the range gate will
continue to move down at the last calculated closure velocity. When this occurs
the SKIN TRK and T light on the DSCG will go out and the range rate digits will
begin to flash at 4 Hz. If memory mode was entered because the target was lost,
the system will drop the lock if the target does not reappear within 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Memory Mode will be entered under several conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual Search is selected (<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#track-switch">Track Switch</a>)</li>
<li>Target is lost</li>
<li>Jamming condition is detected</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="home-on-jam"><a class="header" href="#home-on-jam">Home On Jam</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_jamming_target.jpg" alt="Jamming Target" /></p>
<p>The back bias amplifier in the radar produces a noise signal based on the
overall strength of the echoes. Once this noise signal exceeds some threshold,
the system will consider it a jamming condition and enter Home On Jam. The range
track circuit goes into memory mode, the angle track circuit continues to
operate and track the jamming target in elevation and azimuth.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_home_on_jam.jpg" alt="Home On Jam" /></p>
<p>The Home On Jam condition is also indicated by the engraved H on the WSO DSCG and
the last zero digit of the closure velocity is replaced by a H along with the
closure rate flashing.</p>
<h2 id="spotlight"><a class="header" href="#spotlight">Spotlight</a></h2>
<p>In the 100 and 200 mile ranges, a procedure known as Spotlight can be used to
maintain radar monitoring of a target manually.</p>
<p>Spotlighting entails placing the acquisition cursor over the desired return,
then selecting and holding the full action trigger position of the Antenna Hand
Controller. Doing so, the antenna will nutate and revert to the chosen Polar
Switch selection to increase target definition, but without attempting the
automatic lock-on.</p>
<p>The target can be maintained in a well-observable state by holding full action
and following the target-return with the Antenna Hand Controller until it
reaches a range at which lock-on can be achieved (with the applicable change in
range setting; the radar cannot attempt a lock at an incompatible range
setting).</p>
<h2 id="intercept-computations"><a class="header" href="#intercept-computations">Intercept Computations</a></h2>
<p>The LRU-1 Intercept Computer can calculate firing envelopes for the
<a href="systems/radar/../../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">Sparrow</a> and
<a href="systems/radar/../../stores/air_to_air/aim_9.html">Sidewinder</a> Missiles.</p>
<h3 id="range-strobes"><a class="header" href="#range-strobes">Range Strobes</a></h3>
<p>The DSCG can display two range strobes at any given time representing the
missile envelope. There are three possible strobe types.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Range Indication</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Rmax</td><td>Maximum range of the missile provided the target continues flying on current heading and course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rmax2</td><td>Maximum range of the missile if the target performs the shortest high g turn to tail aspect.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rmin</td><td>Minimum range capability of the missile.</td></tr>

</div>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_target_in_rmax.jpg" alt="Target in Rmax" /></p>
<p>All ranges are calculated for the point the Trigger is pressed and hold down
for release, not the point where the actual release signal is send a few seconds
later. This means if the missile envelope is met on the display, then the Trigger can be
pressed and
the envelope will be valid for missile launch.</p>
<h3 id="allowable-steering-error-ase-circle"><a class="header" href="#allowable-steering-error-ase-circle">Allowable Steering Error (ASE) Circle</a></h3>
<p>The allowable steering error indicates the maximum lead or lag at which the
missile can be launched and will still retain a high probability of hit. The
circle diameter gradually increases in size once Rmax is reached and gradually
begins decreasing in size as the target range approaches Rmin.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_ase_circle.jpg" alt="ASE circle" /></p>
<p>With the Sparrow selected, the max ASE Circle size is 25 degrees for an AIM-7E
and 35 degrees for an AIM-7F.</p>
<p>With the Sidewinder selected, if caged, the ASE Circle size is fixed at 1.2
degrees. With it un-caged the ASE Circle dynamically changes size as described
above, with the max diameter representing 25 degrees.</p>
<h3 id="aim-dot"><a class="header" href="#aim-dot">Aim Dot</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_aim_dot.jpg" alt="Aim Dot" /></p>
<p>The aim dot provides steering commands to the pilot. There are three different
types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collision Steering, this minimizes time to intercept by putting the fighter
on an intercept course.</li>
<li>Transition steering, this begins 2 nmi outside Rmax and steers the aircraft
towards the next steering type.</li>
<li>Lead pursuit, inside Rmax lead pursuit minimizes the missile's post-launch
maneuvers.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="shootin-range-lights"><a class="header" href="#shootin-range-lights">Shoot/In Range Lights</a></h3>
<p>Shoot Lights illuminate provided the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim Dot is Inside the ASE Circle</li>
<li>Target is within Rmax and Rmin</li>
</ul>
<p>If Sparrows are selected then shoot lights are also inhibited when the target
aspect is 90 ±9 degrees (left or right) and the target is lower than 5 degrees
above the horizon. This prevents shooting a Sparrow into the main lobe clutter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 With the Flight Instrument Brightness Knob out of its fully CCW position -

<li>Range is greater than the computed snap-up range.</li>
<li>Altitude is greater than 32,000 ft.</li>
<li>The target is more than 8000 feet above the fighter.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the light is illuminated the azimuth error in the aim dot should be
corrected only when the light goes out. The fighter should snap up to center the
aim dot.</p>
<h3 id="break-x"><a class="header" href="#break-x">Break X</a></h3>
<p>In all modes (except VI) when the target is lower in range than the calculated
Rmin the Break X symbol will be displayed to indicate minimum range condition.</p>
<p>In Visual Intercept (VI) break X is displayed when range is less than 1000 ft.</p>
<p>When break X is displayed, the ASE Circle is also removed.</p>

<h2 id="firing-interlocks"><a class="header" href="#firing-interlocks">Firing Interlocks</a></h2>
<p>There are several interlocks to prevent firing missiles in unfavorable
conditions.</p>
<p>For the Sidewinder the only interlock preventing the missile from being fired is with the
flaps in the down position.</p>
<p>For the Sparrow there are several conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim dot must be within the ASE Circle</li>
<li>The in range and shoot lights must be on</li>
<li>There must be no break X condition</li>
<li>The selected mode must not be Visual Intercept</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Note that SHOOT lights remain off with the Flight Instrument Brightness
Knob out of its fully CCW position. The firing interlocks are not influenced
by this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interlocks are overridden automatically with a HOJ condition or when the
Sparrow is to be fired in boresight mode. The interlocks can be overridden
manually with the Interlock Switch.</p>
<h2 id="boresight-and-cage-condition"><a class="header" href="#boresight-and-cage-condition">Boresight and Cage Condition</a></h2>
<h3 id="boresight"><a class="header" href="#boresight">Boresight</a></h3>
<p>Boresight can be entered either by moving the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#radar-modes-mode">Mode Knob</a> to BST or by depressing the CAGE
button on the throttle. The latter enters a cage condition which is very similar
to boresight entered through BST, with the exception that the cage condition
limits the range to 5 nmi and forces the maneuver setting into the HI position.</p>
<p>When in boresight, the antenna is fixed along the radar boresight line and the
radar returns are displayed on the scope as in an acquisition mode. Acquisition
can be commanded with half action as in automatic search to acquire, and then
full action can be used to initiate track. Range and angle tracking will begin
as normal.</p>
<p><a href="systems/radar/../../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">Sparrows</a> can be fired without tracking the
target. If that is the case, the pilot must position the target on the gunsight pipper and
the WSO can select an appropriate <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#aspect">aspect setting</a>. The
Sparrow can now be fired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Targets need to be within a 5 degree zone or an attempted lock will likely
result in a bad lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cage-condition"><a class="header" href="#cage-condition">Cage Condition</a></h3>
<p>The cage condition is a close combat mode which can be entered at any time by
depressing the CAGE Button on the pilot throttle. This by default puts the radar
into boresight as described above.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_cage_mode.jpg" alt="Cage Mode" /></p>
<p>When the cage condition is present the following changes happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air-To-Air light in the rear pit illuminates.</li>
<li>Trigger control is transferred to the air-to-air weapons (including when ARM
and TV are selected)</li>
<li>Optical sight switches into the A/A mode.</li>
<li>Computer Automatic Acquisition becomes available.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a track condition exists before the CAGE Button is pressed and the pinky
switch on the throttle is in RADAR or HEAT, the radar breaks track and returns
to boresight. If pinky switch is in GUNS, the lock is not broken.</p>
<p>Cage mode can be exited from either cockpit. The pilot can place the Weapon
Select Knob into or out of the B position. If the pilot leaves the Weapon Select
Knob in B, it does not preclude a later entry into Cage mode. The WSO can exit
cage mode by pressing the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#air-to-air-button">Air To Air Button</a>.</p>
<h3 id="computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa"><a class="header" href="#computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa">Computer Automatic Acquisition Mode (CAA)</a></h3>
<p>Once in Cage mode, the radar can be selected in to Computer Automatic
Acquisition using the Nose Gear Steering button on the stick.</p>
<p>In CAA, the radar enters a vertical-oriented scan pattern 78 degrees in height
by 15 degrees wide, the scan is 3 vertical bars wide. Actual radar lock
capability within this scan pattern is from +45 degrees above the horizon line
to -9 degrees below the horizon line due to APQ software limitation. In the
event that the radar finds a suitable target within the scan volume, the target

<p>Radar operation air-to-ground includes the AIR-GRD mode and RDR-PPI and MAP-PPI.</p>
<p>AIR-GRD mode is used as a form of radar ranging for the WRCS Dive Toss mode.
RDR-PPI and MAP-PPI are used for WRCS offset bomb and target find modes.</p>
<h2 id="air-to-ground-ranging"><a class="header" href="#air-to-ground-ranging">Air-To-Ground Ranging</a></h2>
<p>AIR-GRD mode is available when the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#radar-modes-mode">Mode Knob</a> is
positioned in the AIR-GRD position. AIR-GRD is used for air-to-ground ranging
and is available only in AI ranges. In this mode the antenna is fixed to the
radar boresight while also being stabilized in drift, this drift correction can
be removed by setting Drift Out on the <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#stab-switch">Stab Switch</a>
in-case of INS malfunction.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_ground_mode_dt.jpg" alt="Ground Mode during Dive Toss" /></p>
<p>AIR-GRD mode disables <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#angle-track">Angle Track</a> operation and only
uses <a href="systems/radar/interface.html#range-track">Range Track</a>. Once locked on the main lobe
clutter (ground radar echo), it will be tracked in range.</p>
<p>To use AIR-GRD, 5 or 10 nmi range should be selected. Once the target has been
identified the pilot should make a 10 to 40 degree dive towards the target. The
receiver gain should be reduced to produce a clutter signal of approximately 1/2
nmi. This is done to prevent erroneous track of sidelobes which would result in
incorrect ranging information.</p>
<p>When locking the return, the cursor should be placed roughly
at the center of the echo. Flying shallow angles will stretch the return further,
requiring locking roughly one third of the return instead.</p>
<p>The AIR-GRD acquisition procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adjust receiver gain to reduce clutter signal to 1/2 nmi.</li>
<li>Position range strobe over clutter signal.</li>
<li>Press Action Switch to half and then full action. Release after ASE circle is
visible.</li>
<li>Confirm Lock-on.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The radar can track ground clutter from beyond 25,000 ft; however, is
limited by the same number to what can be fed into the WRCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes false tracking can occur, which is indicated by a rapid decrease in
slant range displayed on either the optical sight or radar.</p>
<p>To correct this condition the following actions can be taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Action Switch to half action, release.</li>
<li>Begin acquisition process again.</li>

<h2 id="map-mode-ppi"><a class="header" href="#map-mode-ppi">Map Mode (PPI)</a></h2>
<p>Radar Map mode PPI (position plan indicator) is a display which shows radar
returns plotted with their real position relative to the aircraft. The aircraft
position is at the bottom center of the display, lines parallel to the vertical
axis of the display are parallel to the aircraft track. Lines parallel to the
horizontal axis of the display are offset from the track up to a maximum of half
the current display range.</p>
<p>PPI Mode can be accessed by changing the
<a href="systems/radar/interface.html#display-knob">Display Knob</a> into PPI-WIDE or PPI-NAR. With the
exception of 5 nmi which is always displayed in B-Scope interpretation.</p>
<p>The range cursor is an arc of constant range from the aircraft. The offset
cursor is an offset parallel to the drift of the aircraft, which can be offset
left or right of the aircraft's current track. Offset Cursor and Range Cursor
can only be displayed in PPI modes.</p>
<p><img src="systems/radar/../../img/radar_map_mode_cursors.jpg" alt="Map Mode with Cursors" /></p>
<p>Both Range and Offset Cursor are displayed if
<a href="systems/radar/../../systems/weapon_systems/multiple_weapons_system.html#mode-selection---delivery-mode-knob">Weapon Delivery Mode</a>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_nose_tail_arming.jpg" alt="pilot_nose_tail_arm" /></p>
<p>Beginning from the top of the panel, the four way Nose/Tail ARM switch selects
the solenoids for arming wire capture on MERs and TERs, which then arm the fuzes
at the point of release. Additionally, the switch position can also dictate
in-flight high/low drag release mode for retarded bombs such as the

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_awru.jpg" alt="pilot_awru" /></p>
<p>Used in the BOMBS and RKTS &amp; DISP weapon modes, the AWRU provides interval and
quantity controls for munition delivery. The AWRU has both a manual and
automatic mode, and the resulting function is accessed with the appropriate
settings.</p>
<p>The Interval Knob contains 14 values, providing base interval timing of release
pulses while the bomb release button is held from 1/20th of a second (.05) to 1
second. This value can have a 10x multiplier applied to it using the INTRVL
Switch. In the NORM mode of the INTRVL switch, the release will apply as on the
Interval Knob, whereas when selected to x10, the 10x multiplier will apply - for
example, 1 second in NORM would become an interval of 10 seconds in x10 mode.</p>
<p>The Quantity Knob sets the total number of munitions dropped during a bomb
release hold, and applies the manual or automatic release functions based on the
value selected.</p>
<h2 id="single-manual-1"><a class="header" href="#single-manual-1">Single-Manual: 1</a></h2>
<p>In the 1 position, the AWRU is placed into manual mode. One munition will be
dropped on each bomb release press, with releases across multiple selected
stations dropping in a left-right-left pattern. The bomb release button must be
released, then pressed a subsequent time, to release another round.</p>
<h2 id="single-ripple-2-18"><a class="header" href="#single-ripple-2-18">Single-Ripple: 2-18</a></h2>
<p>In numerical positions 2-18, up to the total number of selected munitions will
be dropped according to the Interval setting. As an example, with a QTY of 6 and
an interval of .20, six bombs will be dropped, one every 2/10ths of a second
from the press of the bomb release button. The sequence will reset upon button
release, allowing subsequent ripples of the same quantity to be dropped.</p>
<h2 id="single-continuous-c"><a class="header" href="#single-continuous-c">Single-Continuous: C</a></h2>
<p>In position C, the quantity of weapons is dictated by how long the bomb release
button is held. The ripple will apply the set interval, releasing one munition
each pulse, until the bomb button is released.</p>
<h2 id="pairs-manual-p"><a class="header" href="#pairs-manual-p">Pairs-Manual: P</a></h2>
<p>Position P places the AWRU into pairs mode. With multiple stations selected,
each time the bomb button is pressed, a weapon will be released from each
station.</p>
<h2 id="salvo-s"><a class="header" href="#salvo-s">Salvo: S</a></h2>
<p>In the S position, the AWRU enters into salvo mode, functioning like
Pairs-Manual with single rounds released from each station, but using the set
interval value to release multiple salvos until the bomb button is released.</p>

panels in the cockpits, and these commands, along with INS data and radar target
ranging, are used by the ballistic computer to provide the release signal.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_wrcs_panel.jpg" alt="wso_wrcs_panel" /></p>
<h2 id="target-range-controls"><a class="header" href="#target-range-controls">Target Range Controls</a></h2>
<p>The Computer Control Panel found in the rear cockpit has three TARGET entry
controls, two RELEASE entries, and a bomb DRAG COEFFICIENT entry setting, as
well as a <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../procedures/bit_tests/wrcs.html">BIT</a> control knob for system function check. Target
entry is relative to the predetermined IP.</p>
<p>The upper range control input is for North/South, and selection of relative
bearing is noted by the N or S prefix at the start.</p>
<p>The middle range control input is for East/West, and like the previous, the E or
W prefix on the range sets the relative bearing direction.</p>
<p>The final ALT RANGE entry is for target altitude- whether the target or RIP
(Radar Identification Point) elevation as MSL, or the target/RIP's pressure
altitude. In Laydown mode the entry refers to the distance between the IP and
the target in hundreds of feet.</p>
<p>Entries for North/South and East/West are in 100 foot increments, and a maximum
value of up to 99,900 feet may be entered for these distances. The ALT RANGE
entry has a maximum of 24,900 in 100 foot increments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The WRCS can be damaged if the ALT RANGE entry is greater
than the aircraft's current MSL (x100) in TGT FIND and OFFSET BOMB modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="release-range-control-1"><a class="header" href="#release-range-control-1">Release Range Control</a></h2>
<p>The Release Range control is used to manually set bomb range in tens of feet,
and is accessible in the Laydown, Dive Laydown, and Offset Bombing modes. The
maximum setting is 9990 feet (999x10), and when used in a WRCS/AJB-7 integrated
delivery, the actual range can be as high as 99,900'.</p>
<p>The Rg control should not be set to the same value as the target range control.
Otherwise, the bomb rack delay may release late, or not at all.</p>
<h2 id="release-advance-control-1"><a class="header" href="#release-advance-control-1">Release Advance Control</a></h2>
<p>Operative in all WRCS and WRCS/LABS integrated motes, the Release Advance
Control works in conjunction with the AWRU to advance the release signal in
milliseconds. Whereas the AWRU Intervalometer setting triggers the release pulse
sequence from the moment the bomb release button is pressed, when the Release
Advance Control is applied in a WRCS driven delivery, the specific bomb location
in a multiple ripple sequence can be calculated in advance, allowing the most
effective spread possible across a given target.</p>
<p>As an example, an AWRU single-ripple quantity release of 4 is selected with an
interval of 120 milliseconds. To place the third bomb in the ripple on target,
the following equation is used:</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/release_advance_formula.jpg" alt="Release Advance Formula" /></p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RA</code> = Release Advance Setting, milliseconds</li>
<li><code>I_R</code> = AWRU Release Intervalometer setting, milliseconds</li>
<li><code>N_Tgt</code> = Impact Sequence number of bomb desired on target</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/release_advance_formula_example.jpg" alt="Release Advance Formula" /></p>
<p>Thus, for this release, we would set the value of RA to 240 msec. This would
produce a spread of two bombs ahead of target, one on the calculated target
point, and one behind.</p>
<p>The maximum setting for the Release Advance Control is 999 milliseconds. A calculator to calculate
the Release advance in-game is provided with
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>
<h2 id="drag-coefficient-control-1"><a class="header" href="#drag-coefficient-control-1">Drag Coefficient Control</a></h2>
<p>Used only in the Dive Toss Mode, this entry is a bias factor prepared for the
ballistic computer to compensate for actual bomb trajectory. The maximum setting
for this value is 9.99.</p>
<h3 id="ballistic-computer"><a class="header" href="#ballistic-computer">Ballistic Computer</a></h3>
<p>The ballistic computer is not directly accessed by the flight crew, but instead
pre-set based on the configured loadout by the ground crew to add the necessary
ejection bias factors. The computer uses these pre-set bias factors in
conjunction with a coefficient setting for munition drag in the Dive Toss mode to
calculate accurate delivery.</p>
<h2 id="wrcs-built-in-test-bit"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-built-in-test-bit">WRCS Built-In-Test (BIT)</a></h2>
<p>The BIT control is used to confirm go/no-go status of the WRCS. The BIT system
checks individual bomb modes individually, and effectivity of the given setting
is confirmed by selecting the desired mode, pushing the center of the knob PUSH
FOR BIT for five seconds, then pressing the FREEZE button in conjunction with the
PUSH FOR BIT button. Confirmation of mode performance will be displayed as GO or
NO-GO. Should a mode be checked a subsequent time during a flight and a NO-GO
response is received, it can be disregarded.</p>
<h2 id="cursor-control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#cursor-control-panel-1">Cursor Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_cursor_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_cursor_control_panel" /></p>
<p>The Cursor Control Panel provides the controls needed for TARGET FIND and OFFSET
bombing modes. The panel has two wheels named ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK,
which is used in the MAP-PPI mode to position their respective cursors over the
Radar Identification Point (from this point denoted as RIP). The ALONG TRACK
control, which presents relative range to the RIP, also includes an internal
switch enabling the cursor instructions to be acknowledged by the WRCS ballistic
computer, and must therefore be the first applied command in the target
insertion sequence.</p>
<p>Once the ALONG TRACK (range hemisphere) and CROSS TRACK (vertical line) cursors
are aligned over the RIP, the FREEZE button is pressed to initiate WRCS ground
path tracking of the specified point. The button remains illuminated until the
RESET button is pressed or another bombing mode is selected.</p>
<p>With WRCS ground tracking initiated, the TARGET INSERT button is pressed for the
ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors to shift from the RIP to the offset target.
Once selected, target steering information is provided from the WRCS to the
BDHI, ADI, HSI, and optical sight. In the AGM-45 missile mode, the AoA Indexers
will provide maneuver commands for level, dive, or climb requirements to align
for seeker acquisition. Further, unless the Pull up tone switch is disabled on the
LABS panel, an audio tone will be triggered from the point of bomb release
button press until the first bomb releases from the aircraft; this function is
nominally for training purposes, as it can preclude other system audio volume.</p>

<p>The TGT FIND switch on the panel functions the same as the TGT FIND mode on the
Delivery Mode Knob. The Delivery Mode Knob overrides this switch in any mode
outside of TGT FIND, and should be set back to NORM. The HOLD position energizes
the target finding circuits in conjunction with any LABS or DIRECT mode the pilot
selects.</p>
<p>The RANGE Switch is functional in any WRCS mode requiring a Release Range
setting. The NORM position applies the noted x10 multiplier on the displayed
Release setting, whereas selecting x100 applies a multiplier of 100 to the
counter value.</p>
<p>The ACTIVATE Switch triggers the prerequisite activation signals to the LABS
circuits once the aircraft has passed within the Release Range. The switch
should only be placed in ON after target insert has been pressed and the ALONG
TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors have transitioned to the target.</p>

<p>The AN/AJB-7 ARBCS is the automated release control system for time or
pitch-relative bombing. Interfacing with the Multiple Weapon Controls, Pedestal
Panel weapon settings, and bomb, laser guided, or the AGM-45, the system
releases the selected munition once the respective Bombing Timer or respective
Bomb Release Angle Computer pitch angle (gyro) target has been achieved.</p>
<p>The left side of the Delivery Mode Knob selects the ARBCS release modes. Both
LOFT and T LAD modes provide weapons release in a pull-up, with LOFT selecting a
4.0 G pull-up schedule and weapon release on achieving a set gyro angle value,
whereas T LAD assumes a 3.5 G pull-up schedule and release at the end of the
Bombing Timer setting. Necessary values for Low and High angle, as well as the
Bombing Timer are found on the provided tables.</p>
<h2 id="bomb-release-angle-computer-1"><a class="header" href="#bomb-release-angle-computer-1">Bomb Release Angle Computer</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_release_angle.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_angle" /></p>
<p>The Bomb Release Angle Computer provides entry of the necessary target pitch
angles for ARBCS bombing modes. The values of HIGH (70 to 179.9 degrees) and LOW
(0 to 89.9 degrees) are controlled using their respective entry knobs.
Internally, the computer contains the release switches, as well as the resolver
to transmit the target angle values to the ADI director pointers.</p>
<p>A calculator for the input values in-game is provided by
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_bombing_timer.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_timer" /></p>
<p>Timers for ARBCS bombing modes are available for PULL-UP (0 to 60 seconds) and
RELEASE (0 to 30 seconds). Both can be set in increments of 0.1 second, with 0.1
second as the minimum setting. The reference windows do not count down during
the bomb run.</p>
<p>When the PULL-UP timer is complete, required PULL-UP signaling will initiate,
along with any ADI director programming to show proper flight path. RELEASE
timing is mode dependent, and will occur once PULL-UP is complete, if required.</p>
<p>In LOFT and O/S modes, only PULL-UP timing is activated, and a value must be set
to energize the ADI pull-up flight path program.</p>
<p>In T LAD and TL, PULL-UP and RELEASE are both activated, in sequence, and both
require a value entry- PULL-UP to energize the flight path programming, and
RELEASE to generate the munition release signal.</p>
<p>In integrated LABS (ARBCS)/WRCS bombing, the above requirements are the same;
however, the WRCS initiates the bomb run timing, rather than pressing the bomb
button. When the WRCS initiates timing, an audio tone is applied to signal timer
start.</p>
<p>A calculator for the input values in-game is provided by
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing

<h2 id="arbcs-indicators"><a class="header" href="#arbcs-indicators">ARBCS Indicators</a></h2>
<p>During ARBCS weapons delivery, a number of indicators are available to confirm
run initiation and at what step of the given run the aircraft is in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon run initiation (bomb button press/WRCS initiation) and PULL-UP timer
start, the Pull-up light turns ON.
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_pull_up_light.jpg" alt="pilot_pull_up_timer" /></li>
<li>At PULL-UP timer completion, the Pull-up light turns OFF, the reticle light
turns OFF, and a steady Pull-up Tone (if switched ON) occurs.</li>
<li>As release pitch angle is attained, the Pull-up light turns ON, the reticle
light turns ON, and the Pull-up Tone stops.</li>
<li>When the bomb button is released, Pull-up light turns OFF.</li>
</ol>
<p>This indication sequence can occur with the master arm in SAFE for training
purposes.</p>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_fast_erect.jpg" alt="pilot_gyro_fast_erect" /></p>
<p>Due to rapid maneuvering during a bombing run, gyro deviation can occur due to
fluid migration. While this deviation will resolve naturally at a rate of 1 to 2
degrees correction per minute over time, it can quickly be corrected by using the
FAST ERECT switch found in the front pilot cockpit on the left side console, at
a rate of 15 degrees per minute. This switch should not be held for more than 60
seconds, or damage can occur to the gyro.</p>

<p>The shutter control lever is a two position lever with positions of CL (closed) and OPEN.
In the CL

<h2 id="reticle-image"><a class="header" href="#reticle-image">Reticle Image</a></h2>
<p>The reticle image that is projected onto the combining glass is composed of a fixed
reticle, roll
reference tabs, and a range bar. The fixed reticle consists of 2-mil diameter pipper
located in the
center of a 25-mil diameter segmented circle, and a 50-mil diameter completed circle.</p>
<p>The roll reference tabs rotate about the 50-mil circle. The roll reference tabs have two
seperate functions. During the offset bombing mode and the target finding mode the roll
tabs provide steering information from the WRCS. The position of the roll tabs, with
respect to the fixed index tabs, indicates the angle between the ground track and course
to the target. In every other mode of operation the roll tabs indicate the aircraft roll
attitude, supplied by the INS.</p>

<p>The range bar is semicircular and appears on the inside of
the 50-mil circle only when a target has been acquired by radar lockon. The instantaneous
length of the range bar, and the rate at which the length is changing indicates the actual
radar slant range and the range between the aircraft and the target. The minimum length of
the range bar (and minimum range indication) exists at the 6 o'clock position. With gun
selected the inside tab of the range bar at 6 o'clock, the actual radar range is 1000 ft.
At the 5 o'clock position the range bar is 2000ft continuing with 1000ft increments per
tab. The maximum range that can be shown is 6667ft with guns selected. When any other mode
than GUN is selected the range bar is 3000ft at the 6 o'clock position and 6000ft at the 5
o'clock position, with increments of 3000ft per tab. The maximum displayable range is then
20000ft.</p>

<p>The reticle cage function is applied through the CAGE button on the throttle. With the
sight operating in the (GUNS) A/A mode and with CAGE pressed (no radar lockon) the reticle
is caged at radar boresight line (RBL). When CAGE is released, a pseudo range of 1000ft is
supplied to the computer but the range bar is not displayed. With radar lockon the
stiffening function is applied as long as CAGE is pressed. The range bar continues to
indicate the actual radar range or the maximum displayable range. When CAGE is released
the reticle moves in azimuth elevation to display the lead required to a maximum of
4000ft. This will only happen with GUNS selected.</p>

<p>The AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod is the successor of the AN/AVQ-10 Pave
Knife and predecessor of the AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack pod. It entered service in 1974
and was replaced from 1982 to 1989 by the Pave Tack pod. It provides a slew-able
TV image for spotting ground targets and can fire laser for determining range
information and to guide laser guided weapons.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_screen_example.jpg" alt="pave_spike_screen_example" /></p>
<p>The line of sight can be controlled by the WSO, using the Antenna Hand Control.
The camera image is displayed on the DSCG scope and can be viewed by both, the
Pilot and the WSO independently.</p>
<h2 id="targeting-pod"><a class="header" href="#targeting-pod">Targeting Pod</a></h2>
<p>The system has an optical camera for daylight operation with one level of
optical zoom, for a wide and narrow (4x) field of view.</p>

<p>The TV image mainly consists of a reticle. The reticle rotates clockwise to
indicate the pods current elevation. At a 90 degree rotation, the pod is looking
straight down. If the reticle is almost upside down, the pod reached its gimbal
limit for the elevation (160 degrees).</p>
<p>The wide field of view is indicated by a circle around the reticle.</p>
<p>On the left, the image displays two cues:</p>

<em>Full Action</em>, back to <em>Half Action</em> and <em>Released</em>. Completing this sequence
will toggle the laser on or off. To enter track mode, one has to complete the
sequence <em>Released</em> to <em>Half Action</em> and back to <em>Released</em>. Holding the trigger

<p>In 12-VIS and 9-VIS, the LOS is set to a fix position.</p>
<ul>
<li>12-VIS: 0 degrees roll, -2 degrees elevation, looking slightly nose down</li>
<li>9-VIS: -90 degrees roll (CW), -90 degrees elevation (down), looking left</li>
</ul>
<p>12-VIS can be a great way to find targets of opportunity, as it allows the pilot
to put a target directly on the nose. The position also corresponds to the caged
HUD reticle. Additionally, if the INS is integrated with the pod, 12-VIS is
roll-stabilized.</p>
<p>The use of 9-VIS is very limited. It is intended to aid in acquiring a target
while observing an area in a turn. The target has to be put on the extension of
the left wing. However, in practice it is very difficult to maintain a turn in
such an attitude.</p>
<h2 id="wrcs-mode"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-mode">WRCS mode</a></h2>
<p>The main mode to acquire targets is the WRCS mode, in which the LOS is set to
the current WRCS target. This usually corresponds to the cursor on the radar
screen, but can also be set manually by the WSO. This enables the crew to spot a
target, or general target area, by using the radar or entering known coordinates
and then slewing the pod to this destination. If no specific target has been
inserted, the WRCS usually defaults to the aircraft position, resulting in the
pod looking straight down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The WRCS mode automatically falls back to the 12-VIS mode in case the WRCS
integration is deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="track-mode"><a class="header" href="#track-mode">Track mode</a></h2>
<p>Once the target, or general target area, has been found using the acquisition
modes, the WSO can enter Track-mode by pressing the trigger on the Antenna Hand
Control to either Half or Full Action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 It is necessary for the trigger to go through the full sequence of for
example <em>Released</em> to <em>Half Action</em> and back to <em>Half Action</em> in order to
enter Track-mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this mode, the Antenna Stick can be moved to slew the pod LOS. Operating the
laser is only available in this mode, and can be activated by pressing the
trigger on the Antenna Stick to Full Action.</p>
<p>Track mode is indicated by the T0 and TTG cues becoming visible on the display.
They also indicate the status during laser operation.</p>
<p>If the INS is integrated with the pod, the image will automatically be space
stabilized on the computed target position. Be aware that the stabilization is
rudimentary and needs constant correction with the stick for the target to be
kept centered.</p>
<p>The stabilization is mostly based on the measured slant range. Accurate slant
range can be obtained by firing the laser. Alternatively, it is computed based
on the aircraft barometric altitude and the target altitude, which can be set by
the WSO on the WRCS panel.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_wrcs_panel_target_altitude.jpg" alt="pave_spike_wrcs_target_alt" /></p>
<p>Without a WRCS integration, a target altitude of 0 is assumed, degrading the
stabilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The pod is not capable of computing a slant range for targets above the own
aircraft altitude (for example when attacking up-hill). Since that is measured
using the barometric altitude, depending on the pressure-setting, this can
lead to erratic behavior during hot days when flying low. Problematic
situations like this were commonly referred to as <em>Idiot mode</em>, as the
tracking system started to behave very odd and it was very difficult to
restore proper behavior. The crew often had to deactivate the INS integration
temporarily in order to disable the automatic tracking.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="memory-mode"><a class="header" href="#memory-mode">Memory Mode</a></h2>
<p>Whenever a target-insert signal is send, the system activates the Memory-mode,
provided it is currently in Track-mode and the WRCS integration is active.</p>
<p>In this mode, the line of sight is slaved to the current WRCS target, even if it
is outside of the pods gimbal limits and cannot be displayed currently. The mode
acts very similar to the WRCS-Acquisition mode.</p>
<p>The memory mode has to be left explicitly again, by either pressing half or full
action on the Antenna Stick.</p>
<h3 id="target-insert"><a class="header" href="#target-insert">Target Insert</a></h3>
<p>A target-insert signal is usually initiated by the WSO pressing the
target-insert button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_cursor_control_panel_target_insert_button.jpg" alt="wrcs_target_insert_button" /></p>
<p>However, when the pod is currently in Track-mode and is maneuvered outside of
its gimbal limits, it will automatically initiate a target-insert signal and
send its current target position to the WRCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If the laser is currently firing, it will automatically be stopped when
hitting a limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This signal then also causes the pod to enter Memory-mode, in which case it will
continue to follow the position now memorized by the WRCS.</p>
<p>Additionally, the signal will also be send if the pod is deselected, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Select Button - Weapon, or</li>
<li>WSO DSCG Mode - not TV (for example switching to Radar)</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="laser-system"><a class="header" href="#laser-system">Laser System</a></h1>
<p>The laser can only be operated in the Track-mode and serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guiding laser guided weapons on a target,</li>
<li>and accurate slant range measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slant range is, besides weapon impact calculations, used for the automatic
target stabilization in Track-mode. If not measured with the laser, it is
computed based on inaccurate INS and WRCS data, resulting in a degradation of
the system.</p>
<p>The laser can be used when the LASER READY lamp is illuminated.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_laser_button.jpg" alt="laser_ready_lamp" /></p>
<p>To setup the laser, a valid code has to first be entered on the Laser Coder
Control panel and transferred to the pod by pressing the Enter-Button. Make sure
that the NO GO light does not remain illuminated.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_laser_code_control.jpg" alt="laser_coder_control" /></p>
<p>The LASER READY push button has to be pushed in for the laser to be armed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the laser is guarded by the nose gear position, which has to be
fully retracted to prevent accidental use on the ground.</p>
<p>Once ready, the laser is fired during track mode by pressing full action on the
Antenna Stick. The status of the laser operation is indicated by the cues on the
display being steady or flashing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 It is necessary for the trigger to go through the full sequence of
<em>Released</em> to <em>Half Action</em>, to <em>Full Action</em>, back to <em>Half Action</em> and
<em>Released</em> in order to actuate the laser. In particular, do not hold down the
trigger but release it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Indication</th><th>T0</th><th>TTG</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>not shown</td><td>not in TRACK mode</td><td>not in TRACK mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>steady</td><td>commanded to fire laser (full action)</td><td>firing laser, accepted range</td></tr>
<tr><td>flashing fast</td><td>not commanded to fire laser</td><td>not firing laser or target too far away</td></tr>
<tr><td>flashing slow</td><td></td><td>firing laser, but range rejected</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The T0 cue indicates intention to fire the laser, while the TTG cue represents
the outcome of the laser usage.</p>
<p>The slant range measured by the laser is compared to the slant range computed
based on INS and WRCS data. If it is not within ±20% percent of that value, it
is rejected. This is indicated by TTG flashing slow.</p>
<p>The system can be forced to use the laser range regardless, by pressing the
Reject/Override Button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_reject_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>In practice, laser measured range is much more accurate than the slant range
computed by the system. Hence, pilots developed a habit of always hitting the
button whenever they fired the laser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 This habit can lead to trouble during shallow attacks, such as when flying
low altitude, where a small input can quickly lead to the slant range measured
by the laser being very off. And hence cause the stabilization to drift off
quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="weapon-release-modes"><a class="header" href="#weapon-release-modes">Weapon Release Modes</a></h1>
<p>The pod offers two additional weapon release modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>WRCS Auto Mode</li>
<li>ROR (Release on Range)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auto-mode"><a class="header" href="#auto-mode">Auto Mode</a></h2>
<p>The main method of weapon delivery with the pod is the WRCS automatic release
mode.</p>
<p>The WRCS has to be integrated with the pod for it to be available, and the pilot
must select TGT FIND as delivery mode, as well as WRCS on the range indicator.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_weapon_selector_tgt_find.jpg" alt="pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find" />
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_range_indicator_wrcs_setting.jpg" alt="pave_spike_range_mode_wrcs" /></p>
<p>This mode works the same as the Dive Toss mode of the WRCS, just that it will
use the pods computed slant range and target instead.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wrcs_auto_release_procedure.jpg" alt="wrcs_auto_release_procedure" /></p>
<p>The TTG cue will move down and meet the T0 cue to indicate the time to release
from maximally 15 seconds.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/ttg_moes_to_tt0.jpg" alt="TTg moves down to T0" /></p>
<h2 id="ror"><a class="header" href="#ror">ROR</a></h2>
<p>Release on range is mostly a backup mode. The pilot must select TGT FIND as
delivery mode, and ROR on the range indicator.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_weapon_selector_tgt_find.jpg" alt="pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find" />
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_range_indicator_ror_setting.jpg" alt="pave_spike_range_mode_ror" /></p>
<p>Weapons will be released automatically, as soon as the computed slant range is
less than the set desired release range. The range is configured on the range
indicator, by setting the mode to SET and rotating the knob below the display.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_range_indicator_set.jpg" alt="pave_spike_ror_controls" /></p>
<p>Best results are achieved during level flight.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/ror_auto_release_procedure.jpg" alt="ror_auto_release_procedure" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-1"><a class="header" href="#other-1">Other</a></h1>
<h2 id="stowing"><a class="header" href="#stowing">Stowing</a></h2>
<p>After turning on the system, the pod can be un-stowed by pressing the STOW push
button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_stow_button.jpg" alt="stow_lamp" /></p>
<p>When un-stowed, the pod moves according to the current selections and
automatically goes into the WIDE FOV.</p>
<p>In the stowed position, the camera is rotated upwards and a cover is moved in
front of it. This protects the camera from stones and other hazards during taxi,
takeoff or low level flight.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/f4_ext_pave_spike_stowed.jpg" alt="pave_spike_stowed" /></p>
<p>The stow-procedure takes about 5 seconds, with the light indicating the current
status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: The stow-position is held electrically and can not be held without
power. Un-powered, the pod swings freely with force. Taking off without first
applying power to the pod, or flying with the pod being powered off, will cause
the pod to leave the stow position. Outside of the stow position, the system
will get damaged through hazards and whenever it is forcefully moved into its
gimbal limits. Damage will not only offset the boresight position, but also
affect other properties, such as movement speed and similar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cooling"><a class="header" href="#cooling">Cooling</a></h2>
<p>The targeting pod has a cooling system installed in the rear section, which
automatically cools the pod by external airflow.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/f4_ext_pave_spike_cooling.jpg" alt="pave_spike_cooling" /></p>
<p>In general, the system is capable of keeping the pods temperature within limits
during all normal operation.</p>
<p>However, if the temperature gets out of control, the Overheat lamp will
illuminate.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_ins_button.jpg" alt="overheat_lamp" /></p>
<p>In this case, make sure to turn off the pod immediately and give it some time to
cool down first. Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging
it irreparably.</p>
<p>A broken pod is generally indicated by the MALF lamp going on and the display
being all black.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_broken_pod.jpg" alt="pave_spike_melted" /></p>
<p>To prolong use of the pod and prevent overheating, limit slow and low-level
flight, as well as continuous use of the laser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: As a rule-of-thumb, do not use
the laser for longer than 15 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses.
Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the pod to 30 minutes.
For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="boresight-1"><a class="header" href="#boresight-1">Boresight</a></h2>
<p>Normally the Pave Spike is correctly calibrated by the ground crew before
getting into the plane, but it can drift due to combat damage or high G maneuvers in which case
an in-flight recalibration by the WSO may be necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Target Designator Control panel provides three knobs to adjust the boresight position
in all three axis (azimuth, elevation and roll) within 2.5 degrees in either direction.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_boresight_knobs.jpg" alt="Boresight Knobs" /></p>
<p>Under perfect conditions, the pod is boresighted parallel to the aircraft datum line.
However, due to lack of a calibration reference, the WSO can only achieve a rough alignment.</p>
<p>As first step, the optical sight should be put into A/G mode and the reticle must be depressed by
around 30 mils. At this setting, the correct boresight position intersects with the
sight reticle at a distance of roughly 20,000 ft to 60,000 ft (200 to 600 indicated on the Range Display).</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_air_to_ground_30_mil_setting.jpg" alt="Sight Settings" />
Next, the aircraft has to be maneuvered to place and hold a distant object, such as a building,
on the pipper of the optical sight.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_boresight_object.jpg" alt="Object on pipper" /></p>
<p>As the pilot holds the object on the pipper, the WSO must put the pod into the 12-VIS acquisition mode,
activate the narrow field of view and can adjust the azimuth and
elevation to align the pod with the object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Since the pod is loaded on the left station, the correct boresight position is offset a
few feet to the left of the pipper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_boresight_aligned.jpg" alt="Pod aligned on object" /></p>
<p>Roll is very difficult to align in-flight; if possible, land first. Then, place
the acquisition switch into 9-VIS and use the Roll Knob to align the pod roughly with the
height of a person standing in the distance.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_boresight_roll_ground.jpg" alt="Roll aligned on tree" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, a rough roll alignment can be achieved in-flight by placing the acquisition switch
into WRCS, integrating WRCS with the pod, and erasing any current target input. This way, the pod
will automatically look straight down.</p>
<p>The aircraft can now be flown directly above a landmark, such as a river and the Roll Knob can be used
to align the line of sight with the landmark.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_boresight_river.jpg" alt="Roll aligned on river" /></p>
<h2 id="bits"><a class="header" href="#bits">BITs</a></h2>
<p>The pod has 5 built-in tests, with BIT 1 being the actual mode used during
normal operation. They can be activated and switched through by clicking the BIT
button below the display. The GO/MALF lights show the result of the BIT:</p>
<ul>
<li>GO - test was successful</li>
<li>MALF - test detected a failure</li>
</ul>
<p>During normal operation, activated through BIT 1, neither of the lights are
illuminated.</p>
<h3 id="bit-0"><a class="header" href="#bit-0">BIT 0</a></h3>
<p>All lights on the Target Designator Set Control illuminate with full brightness.
The pod does not need to be powered up for this test.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_bit_0.jpg" alt="pave_spike_self_test" /></p>
<p>GO/MALF do not indicate test results in this mode.</p>
<h3 id="bit-1"><a class="header" href="#bit-1">BIT 1</a></h3>
<p>The circuits are energized and monitored. If any voltage reading is abnormal,
MALF illuminates.</p>
<p>GO does not illuminate in this mode.</p>
<p>This is the standard operational mode. The pod can be used normally and the
system will continuously monitor the status.</p>
<h3 id="bit-2"><a class="header" href="#bit-2">BIT 2</a></h3>
<p>The system simulates track functionality, simulating all inputs, altitude and
range data.</p>
<p>After about 15 seconds, the test is finished with either GO or MALF
illuminating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For the test to be successful, the aircraft must not be moving, the pod must be
un-stowed and INS must be integrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bit-3"><a class="header" href="#bit-3">Bit 3</a></h3>
<p>This tests the laser energy level. The pod moves to a special position where it
looks inside itself, such that the laser fires against a special sensor mounted
inside the pod.</p>
<p>The pod must be un-stowed and a valid laser code must have been entered, as well
as the LASER READY button being pushed in. The nose gear guard is ignored during
the test, allowing the use of the laser on ground.</p>
<p>Once the pod has reached the test position, the WSO must press and hold the
Reject/Override button to start firing the laser. The laser stops firing when
the button is released.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_reject_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>When the laser fires, a 5 second test program starts, with the sensor measuring
the laser energy. After the 5 second test, either GO or MALF illuminate to
indicate whether the energy level was above the required minimum.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_los_bit_3.jpg" alt="pave_spike_bit_3_az_el" /></p>
<p>The pilot can assist in telling the WSO that the test position has been reached,
as indicated by the Azimuth-Elevation Indicator (1 and 2).</p>
<h3 id="bit-4"><a class="header" href="#bit-4">Bit 4</a></h3>
<p>The system tests the ranging computation by feeding a simulated laser slant
range of 2100 ft (±200). The pilot can confirm this using the Range Indicator
readout.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pilot_range_indicator_bit_4.jpg" alt="pave_spike_bit_4_range" /></p>
<p>After about 8 to 14 seconds, the test is finished and either GO or MALF is lit.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades"><a class="header" href="#upgrades">Upgrades</a></h2>
<p>Based on crew feedback, the Pave Spike targeting pod received two major
upgrades, which are available as separate selectable weapon in DCS.</p>
<h3 id="smart-track"><a class="header" href="#smart-track">Smart-Track</a></h3>
<p>TCTO 518, known as the Smart-Track upgrade, aims at removing the requirement to
press the Reject/Override button to force the laser measured slant range in
situations in which the computed slant range was usually too inaccurate.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wso_target_designator_reject_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>With the upgrade, the system will automatically accept the laser slant range
whenever the pods elevation gimbal is above -7.5 degrees. I.e. in shallow
angles, for example during 12-VIS mode or low altitude attacks.</p>
<h3 id="fast-track"><a class="header" href="#fast-track">Fast-Track</a></h3>
<p>The popular upgrade TCTO 519 overhauls the pods gimbal motors, increasing the
movement speed from 15 dps to 60 dps.</p>

<p>Operation of the AN/ALE-40 is controlled from both the
front and rear cockpit. The CCU initiates the various
modes of operation. The programmer will generate the firing commands in
different combinations.</p>
<p>The pylon mounted dispensers will convert the firing
commands to individually sequenced firing signals. If the operation mode is set
to chaff, the dispensing will start in the left pylon dispenser and then
transfer the dispensing signals to the right pylon dispenser upon depletion of
stores in the left dispenser. If the operation mode is set to flare, dispensing
will start in the right pylon master dispenser and upon depletion of stores the
sequencer switch will transfer the dispensing signal to the left master
dispenser. Flares can also be jettisoned from their dispensers at a rate of 10
flares per second by activating the ripple switch located on the CCU.</p>
<p>Dispensing of countermeasures can be initiated
by either the pilot (Button on the Throttle)
or the WSO (Dispense Button or Ripple Switch on the CCU).</p>
<p>Countermeasures will be dispensed according to Flares Select Switch, CCU and Programmer settings.</p>
<p>They are two important definitions to know when setting up the countermeasures:</p>
<ul>
<li>BURST - single dispense signal</li>
<li>SALVO - group of bursts</li>

<p>The AN/ALE-40 countermeasures dispensers are divided into two distinct dispenser
configurations. The master (outboard) dispenser contains the electronics and
sequencer switch for both dispensers on each pylon and is installed on the
outboard side of the inboard armament pylons. The slave (inboard) dispenser is
installed on the inboard side of the inboard armament pylons and is connected to
the master dispenser by an interconnect cable. The aircraft can be configured
either with four chaff payload modules on all four dispensers or two chaff
payload modules on the slave dispensers and two flare payload modules on the
master dispensers. Only chaff payload modules can be installed on the slave
dispensers; flare payload modules can only be installed on the master
dispensers.</p>
<h3 id="master-dispenser-assembly"><a class="header" href="#master-dispenser-assembly">Master Dispenser Assembly</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Operation of the master dispenser assembly is done automatically by the
ground crew in DCS, according to the AN/ALE-40 loadout selected in the loadout
menu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One master dispenser assembly is installed on the outboard side of each inboard
armament pylon. It consists of a sequencer switch, a breech assembly, a
RESET/OPERATE circuit breaker switch, a payload control switch, a safety pin
switch with safety pin and warning streamer and relevant electrical circuitry.
The sequencer switch converts the firing commands into individual firing signals
for each pyrotechnic squib in both the master and slave dispensers. The breech
assembly provides the interface to mount the chaff or flare payload modules.
Insertion of the safety pin removes electrical power to both pylon mounted
dispensers. After a full chaff or flare module has been loaded, the
RESET/OPERATE switch is placed in OPERATE. The chaff or flare sections will fire
in sequence. After flight, if a partial load of chaff or flares remains, the
switch should be left in OPERATE. If the switch is moved to RESET, the empty
chaff or flare stations have to be stepped through before loaded stations will
fire. The payload selector switch positions C (chaff) and F (flare) only define
the master dispenser mode of deployment and are set automatically in DCS
according to the selected loadout.</p>
<h3 id="slave-dispenser-assembly"><a class="header" href="#slave-dispenser-assembly">Slave Dispenser Assembly</a></h3>

If the payload selector switch is left in the default CS position, one chaff
cartridge will be dispensed for each chaff burst commanded. If the payload
selector switch is set to the CD position, two chaff cartridges will be
dispensed simultaneously, one from each dispenser, for each chaff burst
commanded. The breech assembly provides the interface to mount the chaff payload
module.</p>
<h3 id="flare-housing-adapter"><a class="header" href="#flare-housing-adapter">Flare Housing Adapter</a></h3>

chaff dipoles are ejected from the sleeves and leave the disposable sleeve and
empty squib case behind. The cartridge base provides a recess for the chaff
pyrotechnic squib.</p>

<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_happy_face.jpg" alt="rwr_happy_face" /></p>
<p>The ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver (subsequently RWR) is the F-4E's passive
situational awareness system for detection of airborne and surface-to-air radar
threats. The system captures signals from multiple pairs of directional antennas
installed at the aft of the fuselage, on each wingtip and under the nose; the
difference in relative timing of detection and angle by the antennas is used by
the system to define a relative bearing to the emitting radar. Further
processing of the received radiation references the stored threat catalog to
identify emitter type, as well as to define a relative threat range as a
function of received power versus known output.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_with_contacts.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_with_contacts" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 The ALR-46 is currently installed in the housing of a APR-36 earlier RWR model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting processed threat signal is then presented on the RWR's CRT (cathode-ray tube)
display, with bearing to
the emitter shown on the display with the top relative to the nose (12 o'clock) and the bottom the
tail (6 o'clock), and with proximity to center relative to the system's calculation of the level of
threat - with closer indications being of higher danger, and those within the middle ring being
classified within engagement range. In normal operation, the ALR-46 can present 16 threats on the
CRT concurrently. The highest priority threat as computed by the ALR-46's threat and range catalog
is presented on the display with a diamond superimposed by its symbol; this is considered "floating"
diamond functionality, with the ALR-46 defining priority. In the event of possible engagement by a
threat emitter (concurrent with the illumination of the ACTIVITY and/or MISSILE LAUNCH buttons), the
event is signified by a circle around the emitter symbol.</p>
<h2 id="alr-46-controls"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-controls">ALR-46 Controls</a></h2>
<h3 id="rwr-display-intensity-knob"><a class="header" href="#rwr-display-intensity-knob">RWR Display Intensity Knob</a></h3>
<p>Found adjacent to the RWR situation display in the lower left corner of the panel, the Intensity
Knob functions as a dimmer to control the brightness of the displayed RWR returns. Clockwise raises
the brightness, counter-clockwise lowers the brightness.</p>
<h3 id="excess-noise-strobe-indicators"><a class="header" href="#excess-noise-strobe-indicators">Excess Noise Strobe Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_t_strobe.jpg" alt="rwr_excess_noise_strobe" /></p>
<p>During normal operation, a trio of three T shaped indicators appear in the 9, 12, and 3 o'clock
positions near the center of the RWR CRT. These indicators signify the absence of excess noise in
the low (<num>9</num>), mid (<num>12</num>), and high (<num>3</num>) band amplifier detection. In
the event noise becomes too
significant in a given amplifier channel, the indicator for the respective band will disappear.
Should this occur, a SYS TEST can be performed to confirm the channel is still functioning; in the
event of a pass, the channel can be considered working at a reduced detection capacity.</p>
<p>A fourth indicator may appear as part of the SYS TEST or power up cycle. This fourth indicator in
the 6 o'clock position does not signify any function.</p>
<h3 id="alr-46-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-control-panel">ALR-46 Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_rwr_control_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_control_panel" /></p>
<p>The ALR-46 Control Panel consists of ten multipurpose, illuminated buttons, along with a pair of
rotary knobs for controlling the system's volume and panel brightness.</p>
<p>Controls are duplicated for pilot and WSO. The pilot controls are
directly below the RWR Indicator, while the controls for the WSO are found
below the Central Indicator in the front of the view.</p>
<h4 id="mode"><a class="header" href="#mode">Mode</a></h4>
<p>The ALR-46 defaults on power-up to OPEN mode (<num>1</num>), which presents up to 16 threats on the
display at one time, depending on how many emitters are visible and current system settings (Search,
LOW ALT, etc.). In the event the crew requires immediate prioritization of the most pressing threats
in a saturated environment, the PRIORITY button can be pressed to display the five emitters the
system deems the most dangerous. When pressed, the OPEN illumination will swap to the PRIORITY
position, and revert back upon selection back to OPEN.</p>
<h4 id="search"><a class="header" href="#search">Search</a></h4>
<p>By default, the ALR-46 is programmed to prioritize and display emitters tied to weapons that can
engage and destroy the aircraft. However, missions will require monitoring of early warning and
search radar systems working with longer pulse-widths for extended range detection and tracking of
possible intruders - i.e., the F-4. These emitters can be displayed using the Search mode
(<num>2</num>), which
presents them on the RWR with the S symbol to signify their function as a long range search radar.
Entry into Search mode is displayed on the button with an illuminated "S".</p>
<p>Because of their low threat priority, it is important to note that search radar symbology may often
fall off the display due to their reduced importance - especially when the ALR-46 is placed into
PRIORITY mode.</p>
<h4 id="handoff"><a class="header" href="#handoff">Handoff</a></h4>
<p>The Handoff button (<num>3</num>) provides the opportunity for the flight crew to define the
priority emitting
threat. By default, the ALR-46 defines the highest priority threat as a function of range, current
transmitting mode, and the threat catalog. This priority threat is visualized with a diamond
superimposed around the emitter's symbol. In the event the pilot wishes to define a different
emitter as the target, the Handoff button is pressed and held to cycle the priority diamond through
the various emitters. Once the desired emitter is focused upon and surrounded with the diamond, the
button can be released, and the priority symbol will remain latched with that emitter and
the double caret (&lt;&gt;) symbol on the
button illuminated to signify latched mode. With a latched diamond focus emitter, the system will
remain focused on said emitter until the signal is either lost, the crew selects another focus
emitter with the Handoff button, or the button is pressed momentarily to return to normal floating
diamond threat priority mode.</p>
<!-- ![pilot_rwr_handoff](../../img/pilot_rwr_handoff.jpg) -->
<p>In the event that the emitter is tight grouping of other symbols on the display, the TGT SEP mode
will be applied.</p>
<p>When diamond symbol is latched, the diamond (handoff) audio can be heard through the intercom.
It's a constant synthetical tone generated in the system based on the current PRF
(pulse repetition frequency) of the given emitter. It's not affected by the received power
so the amplitude won't change in time as in some other systems.</p>
<h4 id="launch"><a class="header" href="#launch">Launch</a></h4>
<p>In the event a missile launch is detected by way of discrete SAM guidance commands being received,
the MISSILE LAUNCH indications in this button (<num>4</num>) will illuminate, and a circle is
superimposed
around the threat emitter defined as guiding the inbound weapon. Pressing the button
will initiate the built-in-test which provides <a href="systems/defensive_systems/radar_warning_receiver.html#launch-audio">launch audio</a> through the intercom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Keep in mind that ALR-46 can detect missile launches only from certain systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_launch_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_missile_launch" /></p>
<h4 id="altitude"><a class="header" href="#altitude">Altitude</a></h4>
<p>The ALR-46 utilizes own-ship altitude as a defining aspect of threat priority, thus causing low
altitude AAA and SAM threats to lose priority in the event the aircraft is at an altitude that is
estimated to place it outside of their threat envelope. Activating LOW ALT mode (<num>5</num>)
removes this envelope estimate from the threat prioritization and places low altitude threats back
into priority, useful for circumstances such as a high to low dive attack or target ingress profile,
and is confirmed as the active mode with the illuminated LOW ALT descriptor on the button.</p>
<h4 id="target-separation"><a class="header" href="#target-separation">Target Separation</a></h4>
<p>In the event of a number of emitters being detected at such close proximity that the symbology
overlaps on the RWR display, the Target Separation button (<num>7</num>) provides the option to
expand symbology on the display from emitters in the same area to allow for clarity on the type and
number of radars being detected. Pressing the button triggers the lower TGT SEP illumination on the
button, and any emitter groups the system defines as being eligible for the expanded presentation
will do so for three seconds on the RWR display before reverting back to the standard view.</p>
<h4 id="system-test"><a class="header" href="#system-test">System Test</a></h4>
<p>The system power on test (<num>8</num>) provides a three band (1 low, 2 mid, 3 high) check in all
four quadrants for proper sensitivity, along with an angle confirmation of 225 degree
relative bearing for diagnostic purposes. The test sequence begins with 1s in all four quadrants,
with the lower left value in a diamond (signifying a heading of 225, which is displayed on the
panel); the second and third continue this process, cycling band 2 and band 3. The tests are
accompanied with a sequence of tones for adjustment of audio monitoring level.</p>
<p>This button is also used when switching the threat files. Exact procedure is explained
in the <a href="systems/defensive_systems/radar_warning_receiver.html#symbology">symbology</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="unknown"><a class="header" href="#unknown">Unknown</a></h4>
<p>When an emitter is detected that does not have a catalog entry, but is recognized by received power,
duration, and pulse as being a possible threat, the U indicator on the Unknown button (<num>9</num>)
will flash. Pressing the button will provide a U symbol on the RWR CRT at the correct azimuth
position for reference and monitoring.</p>
<p>The default condition of the Unknown button is with the U symbol illuminated, but steady.</p>
<h4 id="activity-power"><a class="header" href="#activity-power">Activity Power</a></h4>
<p>In the event SAM guidance commands are detected, the ACTIVITY button (<num>10</num>) will
illuminate. This
button's function is similar to the MISSILE LAUNCH indication insofar as that it responds to a
guidance directive to a SAM, but does not respond to discrete changeover signals. Thus, an
illuminated ACTIVITY warning may in fact indicate a launch, depending on the system engaging the F-4
and the circumstances surrounding it. The indication will provide a circle around the threat
emitter.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/rwr_activity_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_activity_power" /></p>
<h4 id="system-power"><a class="header" href="#system-power">System Power</a></h4>
<p>The System Power button (<num>11</num>) is the on/off switch for the ALR-46. When pressed to
activate the
system, the RWR control panel and display will cycle through their initial 9-second warmup, with the
display and illuminated buttons undergoing rapid flashing as the system is prepared for use and
proper functioning is confirmed. Search mode is deactivated by default upon startup, and if in the
event the aircraft was powered down and restarted, the altitude priority mode (LOW ALT or normal)
will be in the same state it was left prior to shut down.</p>
<p>In the event of a system power failure, the ALR-46 has an automatic restart function. Once power is
recovered, the receiver will restart after a fifteen-second delay, in addition to its 9-second power
on self test. The system will resume state in the same fashion as a normal restart - with Search
mode deactivated and the altitude priority as when power was lost.</p>
<h4 id="audio-knob"><a class="header" href="#audio-knob">Audio Knob</a></h4>
<p>The AUDIO Knob (<num>6</num>) is the direct volume control for the situational audio from the
ALR-46. Turning
the knob clockwise increases the audio volume, turning counter-clockwise lowers the audio volume.</p>
<h4 id="dim-knob-dimmer"><a class="header" href="#dim-knob-dimmer">DIM Knob (Dimmer)</a></h4>
<p>The DIM knob (<num>12</num>) on the ALR-46 control panel manages the brightness setting of the
illuminated control buttons; turning the knob clockwise increases the brightness, counter-clockwise
reduces the brightness.</p>
<h2 id="audio-alerts"><a class="header" href="#audio-alerts">Audio Alerts</a></h2>
<h3 id="new-guy-audio"><a class="header" href="#new-guy-audio">New Guy Audio</a></h3>
<p>The audio alert issued when a new
emtter is first displayed, or when PRF (pulse repetition frequency)
of an existing display
changes is known as <em>new guy audio</em>. It consists of three
beeps within 1.5 seconds, each at PRF of emitter which has
diamond symbol. The new guy audio alerts a crewmember
to a change in threat environment so he can check his
azimuth indicator for update. The AUDIO control on
indicator-control can adjust volume from maximum to
completely off.</p>
<h3 id="launch-audio"><a class="header" href="#launch-audio">Launch Audio</a></h3>
<p>The synthetic launch tone generated
when an emitter goes into launch state is called <em>launch
audio</em> or <em>ML interrupt audio</em>. It consists of approximately
seven beeps in 1.5 seconds of a 1 kHz tone generator in the
signal processor. Only one launch audio is generated per
launch; i.e., after approximately seven beeps, no launch
audio is heard from that emitter.</p>
<p>Volume of the launch audio is controlled by the main
RWR audio knob as well as dedicated ML audio knob in each cockpit.
The resultant volume is a function of both knobs positions.</p>
<h2 id="symbology-1"><a class="header" href="#symbology-1">Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The ALR-46 features a limited number of symbols for the different radar threats. The following
symbols can stand for the different threats. The ALR-46 can save up to three files containing threat
tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Land file (default) - land and air threats</li>
<li>Sea file - sea and air threats</li>
<li>Training file - additional configurable threats (empty by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pilot can switch between the land and the training file by
simply pressing the SYS TEST (<num>8</num>) and within a one second timespan pressing the TGT
SEP (<num>7</num>) button. A T symbol will be displayed within the lower portion of azimuth when the
training file is selected. To switch to the sea file simply press the SYS TEST (<num>8</num>) button
and within a one second timespan press the UNKNOWN (<num>9</num>) button. When the sea file is
selected a ship symbol will be displayed in the lower half of azimuth.</p>

<h2 id="threat-indications"><a class="header" href="#threat-indications">Threat Indications</a></h2>
<p>Due to weapon systems all operating very differently, the RWR indications always
have to be interpreted individually per threat platform. This requires
understanding how the expected threats work, how they guide missiles, whether
they have separate search and tracking radars or similar.</p>
<p>The following table gives an overview on how the RWR indicates certain events for
commonly faced threats.</p>
<p>Actual missile launches can only be detected by the presence of C/D band
guidance signals, indicated by the <strong>LAUNCH</strong> lamp. This is the case for some
SAM systems. Some actively guided radar missiles can be identified individually
and will be shown with specific Missile symbols.</p>
<p>Beyond those clear indications, missile launches are often preceded by the
target platform activating a specific tracking-radar or significantly increasing
its PRF, which the RWR often picks up and plays a <strong>New-Guy</strong> tone for (3 short
beeps). Activating <strong>HANDOFF</strong> mode often makes the high pitched PRF tone
clearly audible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Symbols <strong>S</strong> and <strong>U</strong> require activating the <strong>SEARCH</strong> and <strong>UNKNOWN</strong> mode
respectively to be shown on the screen.</p>

<p><em>"It's got ECM, it's got ECCM, IBM,
folk, we'll give you M&amp;Ms"</em></p>
<p>The Phantom can be equipped with ECM pods capable of jamming radar signals to
protect it from getting tracked by other aircraft or radar guided missiles.</p>
<p>During its service, it saw a number of pods with different capabilities.</p>
<p>Early pods such as the AN/ALQ-71 or AN/ALQ-87 have been used effectively during
the Vietnam war. During mid 1970s, mostly AN/ALQ-119 and AN/ALQ-131 have been in
service.</p>
<p>The Phantom supports ECM pods on the two inboard pylons (stations 4 and 6) and
the inner wing pylons (stations 2 and 8). However, the ECM signals are connected
in a chain on each side respectively, only allowing control of one jammer pod
per side. Additionally, many pods have restrictions only allowing them to be
loaded on some specific pylons. For example, AN/ALQ-119 and AN/ALQ-131 may not
be equipped on the right inboard pylon (station 6).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to engine limitations, we can not influence the effectiveness
of the Phantoms jammers.
Equipping multiple pods does not increase their strength or coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="controls-1"><a class="header" href="#controls-1">Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_ecm_control_panel.jpg" alt="ecm" /></p>
<p>The electronic counter-measurement systems are all controlled by
the WSO via controls on the right sub-panel.</p>
<p>The controls are duplicated for any pod carried on the left stations (<num>4</num> or <num>2</num>)
and for the right stations (<num>6</num> and <num>8</num>) respectively.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the modes, techniques and exact operation of the lights (<num>3</num>)
depend on the loaded jammer model.</p>
<p>Generally, the jammers differentiate between two modes or techniques that can be used.
Both of which usually have a warmup phase indicated by the Standby Lights on the panel.</p>
<p>The knob (<num>1</num> and <num>4</num>) can be used to place either technique in Standby or, once ready,
activate transmission (XMIT 1, XMIT 2, BOTH).</p>
<p>Some jammer models can also detect that they are actively jamming an enemy radar,
indicated by the AI light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: To prevent exposing personnel to radiation, the mode knob must not
be placed in XMIT while on ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="reset-button-and-lamp-1"><a class="header" href="#reset-button-and-lamp-1">Reset Button and Lamp</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_ecm_reset_button.jpg" alt="ecm" /></p>
<p>The reset lamp (<num>3</num> lowest red one), if lit, indicates a fault in the jammer system.
Flashing indicates an overheating condition, in which case the pod
should be turned off to prevent damage.</p>
<p>In case of a fault, the reset button (<num>2</num>) can be pressed to reset the
jammer system (similar to turning it OFF and back ON), in which case it will
run through the warmup period again. If the fault could be cleared, the light will go off.</p>
<h2 id="analq-131"><a class="header" href="#analq-131">AN/ALQ-131</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/f4_ext_ecm_pod.jpg" alt="AN/ALQ-131" /></p>
<p>In service between 1970 and 1990; may not be equipped on the right inboard station 6.</p>
<p>Technique 1 and 2 are identical and require a warmup period of around 3 minutes
before being activated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The warmup logic is hardwired - flipping the pod off and on, or having a
short loss of power, will result in the full warmup period being required again before use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standby lamps illuminate to indicate that warmup phase has finished and the
technique is ready to be activated.</p>
<p>The pod can overheat, in which case the fault lamp will illuminate.
In this case, make sure to set the mode to Standby immediately and give it some time to
cool down first. Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging
it irreparably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: As a rule-of-thumb, do not transmit
for longer than 20 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses.
Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the jammer to 30 minutes.
For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_master_caution_light.jpg" alt="pilot_master_caution" /></p>
<p>Found in the front cockpit, the MASTER CAUTION provides the pilot with an
up-front warning of potential hazard to the aircraft. The MASTER CAUTION
illuminates concurrently with most warning lamps on the telelight panel and the
generator indicators; warnings that do not set off MASTER CAUTION are noted in
the Telelight Panel list.</p>
<p>MASTER CAUTION can be deactivated by the pilot pressing the reset button on the
right console. However, it is important to note that pressing MASTER CAUTION
does not clear a warning on the telelight panel; instead, the warning will
remain until rectified. Should a second event occur in a system already giving a
telelight warning, MASTER CAUTION will not illuminate a second time.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_warning_light_test_switch.jpg" alt="pilot_warning_light_test_switch" /></p>
<p>Confirmation of bulb function can be performed using the Warning Test Light
Circuit found on the interior light control panel in both cockpits. These do not
perform a function text for the individual warning systems, only confirm that
the lights will illuminate.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_fire_detector_system.jpg" alt="pilot_engine_fire_test_group" /></p>
<p>On the right upper instrument panel in the front cockpit are four warning lamps-
two FIRE and two OVRHEAT lights, one for each side. Should a fire be detected in
an engine compartment, the applicable FIRE lap will illuminate. Overheat
detectors are mounted at the rear of the fuselage adjacent to the engine
nozzles, and illuminate the respective OVRHEAT lamp should temperatures become
dangerous to the aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="fire-test-button-1"><a class="header" href="#fire-test-button-1">Fire Test Button</a></h3>
<p>When pressed, this button tests for functionality of the FIRE and OVRHT lamps.
Can also be used in conjunction with the Warning Lights Test switch to confirm
detection and continuity performance of the fire and overheat warning systems.
Holding the Warning Lights Test switch in the WARN TEST position, then
simultaneously pressing and releasing the Fire Test Button performs the test.
Proper system function is confirmed with the four FIRE and OVRHT lamps off while
the Fire Test Button is pressed, then illuminating when it is released.</p>
<h2 id="ejection-seats"><a class="header" href="#ejection-seats">Ejection Seats</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/ext_f4_ejection.jpg" alt="ext_view_ejection_seat" /></p>
<p>The Phantom II uses the Martin Baker Mk. H-7 ejection seat in both positions for
safe aircrew extraction in the event of airframe loss. Triggering ejection using
the face curtain or lower ejection handles fires the seat mounted initiator that
jettisons the canopy. Once the canopy is clear of the airframe, the ejection gun
primary charge fires, unlatching the seat from the cockpit and initiating seat
climb-out. As the seat rises, restraints on the legs pull them back for clearance
and the drogue timer is set. At the appropriate height, a lanyard attaching the
rocket motor initiator to the airframe trips the firing pin for the main rocket
engine to clear the aircraft. The previously set drogue gun fires at this time,
deploying a pair of small chutes to stabilize the seat in attitude and initiate
deceleration.</p>
<p>Once the seat has reached a pre-set barometric altitude between 11,500 and
14,500 feet, or momentarily after stabilization if lower, scissor mechanisms
release the crew-member with the survival kit-containing seat pan from the
ejection frame and deploys the main chute. In the event of ejection below the
barostat altitude, the WSO chute is fully deployed at 5 seconds after ejection
initiation, and the pilot one-second later.</p>
<h3 id="eject-light"><a class="header" href="#eject-light">Eject Light</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/wso_eject_light.jpg" alt="wso_eject_light" /></p>
<p>In the event of loss of intercom power, the pilot can warn the WSO to prepare
for ejection by pressing the EJECT switch found on the left canopy sill forward
of the flap switch. This illuminates a pair of warning lamps found on the rear
cockpit indicator panel.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_eject_light.jpg" alt="pilot_eject_light" /></p>
<h3 id="command-selector-valve-handle"><a class="header" href="#command-selector-valve-handle">Command Selector Valve Handle</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/wso_ejection_selector.jpg" alt="wso_command_selector_valve" /></p>
<p>To the left and above the rear cockpit instrument panel is the Command Selector
Valve Handle. This handle determines the sequence by an ejection initiated from
the rear seat - both seats, or the rear seat only. The handle is marked PLT EJECT
PULL TURN. When the handle is oriented vertically, single seat ejection is
selected; to set dual seat ejection, the handle is rotated clockwise to the
horizontal.</p>
<p>All ejections initiated from the front seat are dual ejections.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_external_stores_emergency_release.jpg" alt="pilot_external_stores_emergency_release" /></p>
<p>Found on the front left cockpit sub-panel, the External Stores Emergency
Release, also known as the panic button, will release all air to ground
munitions, external tanks, and any pods subject to jettison. Sparrow and
Sidewinder missiles, along with all pylons, will remain in place. Pushing the
button will show the yellow paint inside its recess to confirm its actuation.
Performing the actuation disengages external fuel tank transfer automatically,
permitting proper flow of internal wing tanks without further pilot action. The
button is active so long as the aircraft gear is up, or, in the event of a
forward gear handle failure, so long as the rear gear handle remains IN, and
weight is off wheels.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_selective_jettison_control.jpg" alt="pilot_selective_jettison" /></p>
<p>Wing and centerline stores can be jettisoned independently using the Jettison
Knob in the STORES position, selecting the desired Station Select Buttons to
release, and pressing PUSH TO JET. Any pylon or missile launcher at the station
will remain in place, but stores - including MERs and TERs, will be released.</p>
<p>As example, to jettison the right and left external fuel tanks, the pilot must
select <em>STORES</em> on the knob, press the corresponding station select buttons <em>LO</em>, <em>RO</em>
and then push the jettison button.</p>
<h3 id="aim-7-jettison"><a class="header" href="#aim-7-jettison">AIM-7 Jettison</a></h3>
<p>AIM-7 Sparrow missiles are released individually using the L/R FWD or L/R AFT
positions on the Jettison Knob, then pressing PUSH TO JETT.</p>
<h3 id="agm-65-jettison"><a class="header" href="#agm-65-jettison">AGM-65 Jettison</a></h3>
<p>To release AGM-65 missiles, choose TV or ARM on the Weapon Select Knob, press
the desired Station Select Button(s), select L WING or R WING for the Jettison
Knob, and press PUSH TO JETT. One missile is released per press; once desired
rounds are removed from one wing, select the other wing with the Jettison Knob
and repeat the PUSH TO JETT cycle.</p>

<p>Air-To-Ground Ordnance is mostly carrier on pylons 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Pylons 2 and 8 are special, since they can be equipped with the
Special-Weapons-Adapter (SWA) and have additional attach-points on their sides
(labelled 2L, 2R, 8L, 8R) for loading AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles without
occupying the entire pylon.</p>

<p>💡 AIM-9 Sidewinder can be loaded onto pylon 2 and 8 additionally to other
ordnance. Hence, it is still possible to equip for example a Maverick on the
same pylon.</p>

<p><img src="stores/../img/m61.jpg" alt="m61" /></p>
<p>The General Electric M61 Vulcan cannon finally went to war as an integral part
of the Phantom with the advent of the F-4E, with the nose profile and APQ-120
modified to fit the weapon. Carrying 639 rounds in the internal drum, the
six-barreled Gatling style rotary cannon provides a user-selectable rate of fire
from 4000 to 6000 rounds per minute, delivering a muzzle velocity in excess of
3,450 ft/s, with armor piercing incendiary and high explosive incendiary round
options available. Useful in both air-to-air and air to ground roles, the Vulcan
was used for four confirmed kills by the USAF over Vietnam with the F-4E.</p>
<p>Accumulated gas is vented by ram air entering the Gun Purge Door on the nose of
the aircraft. The door is held closed by hydraulic pressure and will
automatically open to release the gas from firing the gun. It closes after the
gas pressure has reduced below a threshold or the gun is de-energized, for
example when switching Master Arm or all rounds have been fired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The venting process takes between 10 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the
burst duration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Do not spool up the engines as long as ground personnel is working
on the door. It will forcefully close automatically as soon as hydraulic
pressure is obtained.</p>

<h3 id="employment"><a class="header" href="#employment">Employment</a></h3>
<p>To utilize the M61, the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">GUN station select switch</a>
must be selected, the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm</a> must be
ON, and the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#head-up-display-indicators">Gun selection</a>
on the Pinky Switch (Aft) must be actuated. This will illuminate the GUN lamp on
the Head Up Display.</p>
<p>For air-to-air usage, the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a> should be
selected to A/A mode. In air-to-air mode, the optical sight functions as a lead
computing optical sighting (LCOS), thus maneuvering in both elevation and
azimuth relative to a radar locked target, or a default 1000' range setting in
the event of no lock. With a lock, the range bar presentation is relative to
6700' just to the left of the tick at the 1 o-clock position, down to 1000' at
the 6 o-clock position.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/radar_gun_lock.jpg" alt="radar_gun_lock" /></p>
<p>For air to ground use, the optical sight should be selected to A/G mode, the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#delivery-mode-knob">Delivery Mode knob</a>
should be set in the OFF or Direct mode, and the desired
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.html#reticle-depression-knob">sight depression mil setting</a>
be entered for the intended attack profile. Depression is set relative from the
Fuselage Reference Line (FRL). While Depression will lower the reticle in
elevation, there is no azimuth drift due to relative aircraft motion.</p>
<p>Gun rate is controlled with the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#rate-of-fire-switch">Rate switch</a> on the
Pedestal panel, and is selectable as High (6000 rounds per minute) or Low (4000
rounds per minute). Also on the Pedestal panel is the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#rounds-remaining-indicator">gun rounds remaining indicator</a>.</p>
<p>Of note is the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear</a> function; the
cannon will fire approximately between 5 and 11 rounds from the point the pilot
has released the trigger to clear all bolt actions in the cannon; this spin-down
takes approximately one second, and the gun cannot be fired again during this
operation. While the Pedestal panel carries the Auto Clear switch, this switch
does not have any control over the internal M61A1 cannon, and can only
deactivate round clearance for podded external cannon installations.</p>
<h3 id="sight-depression"><a class="header" href="#sight-depression">Sight Depression</a></h3>

<h2 id="external-cannon-pods-suu-16a-and-suu-23a"><a class="header" href="#external-cannon-pods-suu-16a-and-suu-23a">External Cannon Pods SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/suupods.jpg" alt="SUU pods" /></p>
<p>Built to both provide gun capability to aircraft that did not mount them
internally, and to increase available direct fire in the close air support
mission, the SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A gun pods were both built around the M61A1 and
a 1200 round ammunition load. Both pods are fixed-rate at 6000 rounds per
minute, and up to three can be concurrently installed and driven by the fire
control system; while up to five can be loaded for ferry purposes, and
promotional images have shown such a configuration, only three can be activated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The inner wing pylons 2 and 8 are not wired to operate the pods. Only the
center station and the outer wing pylons can fire the guns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary difference between the -16/A and -23/A pods are their method of
power; the former using a ram air turbine arrangement to drive its motor, while
the latter is internally powered. This difference had an effect on relative
utility - while the -23/A could be fired at any airspeed, thus allowing it to be
loaded onto slower aircraft, the -16/A's ram air turbine required a minimum
speed of 300 knots to fire, and only reached its optimum performance above 400
knots. Both pods have an auto-clear function for safety, which cause rounds
loaded in the breeches to be released back into the ammo bin, which does entail
a momentary delay of one to two seconds prior to being able to fire the pod
again.</p>
<h3 id="external-employment"><a class="header" href="#external-employment">External Employment</a></h3>
<p>Activation of the SUU pods are performed by selecting their respective
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">Station Select buttons</a>,
and placing the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#delivery-mode-knob">Delivery Mode knob</a>
in OFF or Direct.
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#weapon-selector-knob">The Weapon Selector knob</a>
can be in any position other than TV or ARM, unless CAGE mode is activated. The
desired
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear setting</a>
should be selected, and
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm</a> set to ON
to activate the pod. On the SUU-16, the Master Arm activation deploys the ram
air turbine.</p>
<p>Installed, the guns are boresight along the Fuselage Reference Line. Thus, with
the <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a> in air to
air mode, the rounds will fall in accordance with reticle center, just as the
main cannon- only with the natural offset of their respective pylon position,
thus allowing for effective natural gunnery, if only affected by a moderate
increase in resulting CEP. In the same fashion, in air to ground mode, the SUU
pods observe the same performance relative to the reticle depression schedule as
the internal cannon, again, with their respective offsets from centerline and
CEP increase.</p>
<p>To safe the gun pods after combat, prior to deactivating
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm</a>, the
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear</a> switch should
be placed into the Auto Clear position, the trigger squeezed momentarily, and
the respective
<a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">Station Select buttons</a>
pushed to off. On the SUU-16, this will close the ram air turbine.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II stands as an enduring testament to aerial supremacy, owing much of its
reputation to its formidable air-to-air capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_7.html">AIM-7 Sparrow missile</a> takes center stage in the Phantom II's air-to-air
capabilities. Comprising a substantial portion of the F-4E's air-to-air armament,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_7.html">Sparrow's</a> radar-guided system allows pilots to engage adversaries before they
enter the visual horizon.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/real_life_aim_7_hawaii.jpg" alt="real_life_aim_7" /></p>
<p>In close-quarters engagements, the F-4E relies on the <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_9.html">AIM-9 Sidewinder,</a> a short-range,
infrared-guided missile celebrated for its agility and responsiveness. Constituting a vital
component of the Phantom II's air-to-air weaponry, the Sidewinder excels in the intense and dynamic
scenarios of dogfights.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aim-7-sparrow"><a class="header" href="#aim-7-sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim7.jpg" alt="aim7" /></p>
<p>The AIM-7 is a semi active radar missile with a maximum launch range of approx.
26 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Originally designated the AAM-N-6 Sparrow III, the AIM-7 Sparrow saw initial
service entry with the United States Navy in 1958. Unlike the beam-riding AIM-7A
(AAM-N-2 Sparrow I), which required the launching aircraft to maintain boresight
on the target for the flyout of the weapon, the semi-active radar homing AIM-7C
could effectively engage a maneuvering target well off boresight, so long as the
designating aircraft's radar could maintain a lock during the missile's
intercept. The AIM-7C quickly gave way to the 7D, which saw a number of kills
over Vietnam, and the 7E, which scored the majority of the type's kills in
Southeast Asia. Additionally, the F-4E saw compatibility with the AIM-7F and
AIM-7M.</p>
<p>Utilization of the AIM-7 begins with tuning the onboard rounds, performed with
the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
, selecting it into the CW ON position. This tuning process takes approximately
one minute, and can be initiated once power has been applied for at least one
minute to the radar (any position out of OFF) in most operating environments
(ambient temperature below 90 degrees F). The missiles are properly tuned when
the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#missile-status-lights">missile status light</a>
(RDR) is illuminated in each station carrying a Sparrow missile for at least one
minute. After successful tuning, the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
can be returned to the STBY (Standby) position. The status lamps will turn off
once returned to STBY. Once in the combat area, the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
should be returned to the CW ON position, to maintain proper missile tuning
state during the engagement.</p>
<h2 id="employment-1"><a class="header" href="#employment-1">Employment</a></h2>
<p>To employ an AIM-7, the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a> should be
placed into the A/A position, which stabilizes the Reticle at the Radar
Boresight Line in the window. The roll tabs function to provide the pilot with
relative roll attitude guidance in instrument conditions (weather or nighttime),
and the right side of the 50 mil diameter circle (outer) functions as a range
bar when a radar lock is achieved against a target, displaying ranges up to
20,000' (top) to 3000' (bottom), with 12,000' signified at the 3 o-clock
position. It is also possible to employ an AIM-7 using the ACM Mode via pressing
the Cage Button first and than pressing the CAA Button to accomplish a lock.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/radar_missile_lock.jpg" alt="range_bar_radar_guided_missile" /></p>
<p>When radar lock against a target is achieved with AIM-7 selected, a pair of
strobes surround the locked target in azimuth. Identified as Rmax and Rmax 2,
they represent effective ranges against a 1 G target (Rmax), and a high rate
maneuvering target based on altitude (Rmax 2, representing 8G up to 20k, 6G to
35k, and 4G above 35,000'). When a missile is launched, the Rmax 2 strobe falls
to the bottom of the display, and begins driving upwards towards the target
lock; this functions as a missile flyout timer. When the timer reaches the
locked target, it can be assumed the missile has arrived. The display does not
provide Rmin, but instead reverts to a break X warning superimposed over the
radar image should Rmin be attained for a Sparrow launch.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/radar_screen_radar_missile_lock.jpg" alt="radar_screen_radar_missile_lock" /></p>
<p>Prior to engagement, a determination must be made as to whether or not the
missile <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
will be kept in, or positioned out. The interlocks preclude an AIM-7 shot when
outside of effective firing parameters, those being the missile in range
(illuminating the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.html#in-range-light">IN RANGE light</a>), the
target aim dot within the ASE (Allowable Steering Error) circle on the radar
display, and the radar display mode out of VI (Vis-Ident mode).</p>
<p>With the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
in, should any of the three aforementioned restrictions be met - target out of
range, aim dot outside the ASE, or the radar left in VI, a trigger actuation
will not cause the release of a missile. With
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a> out, an
AIM-7 will be released no matter the condition of the three interlocks.</p>
<p>When parameters are met, the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/overhead_indicators.html#shoot-lights">SHOOT lamps</a> will
illuminate. Found in both cockpits, these lights reinforce the condition of good
launch conditions for the AIM-7. In the event a target enters a main beam
clutter situation (aspect angle between 81 and 99 degrees and lower than 5
degrees above the horizon), the lights will turn off, even though the interlock
requirements are met. Maneuver should be utilized to bring the target outside
this region prior to launch.</p>
<p>At the point of engagement, AIM-7 missiles are selected using the Pinky Switch
on the outboard (left) throttle arm, selecting the forward position. This
illuminates the RADAR lamp on the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#head-up-display-indicators">Head Up Display panel</a>.</p>
<p>Before employing the AIM-7E Sparrow, a delay of four seconds should be given if
the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
is set in the ON position prior to radar lock on, or a delay of two seconds if
the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
is set to ON after radar lock on. This is due to the set-in period of the
missile speed-gate. With the AIM-7F, this delay is reduced to two seconds with
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
On prior to lock, or immediately after selecting
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
to On if lock on was achieved first. Should these delays not be adhered to, the
missile may fail to track because of improper target doppler injection.</p>
<p>With the target in parameters or
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a> out,
pressing the trigger fires off an AIM-7. A second AIM-7 can be fired immediately
at the same target, if desired, by releasing, then squeezing the trigger a
second time- holding it on the second actuation.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/ext_launch_seq_radar.jpg" alt="ext_launch_sequence_radar" /></p>

<ol>
<li>Left Forward Station</li>
<li>Right Forward Station</li>
<li>Left Rear Station</li>

</ol>
<p>In the event of a centerline store or tank precluding forward missile release,
the
<a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#centerline-tank-aboard-light">CL TK lamp</a>
will illuminate. Rear missiles may still be fired, and the forward missiles may
be fired if the centerline tank is dropped or MER is jettisoned. The lamp also
illuminates in the event of a BRU-5/A in the centerline position; however, a
missile can be launched in that condition. The Aero-27 precludes any release,
even if the round has been dropped.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim9.jpg" alt="aim9" /></p>
<p>Entering service with the United States Navy in 1956, and finally accepted by
the United States Air Force in 1964, the short range, infrared seeking AIM-9
Sidewinder is considered by most to be the world's first truly effective air to
air guided missile. Beginning with the AIM-9B and maintaining compatibility to
the AIM-9M in US service, the Sidewinder provided the Phantom II with a capable
close-in weapon system against rapidly maneuvering opponents.</p>
<h2 id="employment-2"><a class="header" href="#employment-2">Employment</a></h2>
<p>Employment of the AIM-9 can be performed with or without a radar lock, and is
initiated by selecting Master Arm to ON and selecting the Throttle Pinky Switch
to the center position for Heat. The HEAT lamp on the Head Up Display will
illuminate, and available AIM-9 missiles will illuminate on the Missile Status
Panel. The Optical Sight should be selected to A/A, and the reticle will
stabilize at the Radar Boresight Line, which is the boresight location for the
Sidewinders on the rails.</p>
<p>Should a radar lock be achieved, the sight will display the range bar on the
right side as previously described, with 20,000' indicated at the top, and
3,000' range indicated at the bottom. With a radar lock on, the radar will
display a pair of strobes signifying Rmax and Rmin for the Sidewinder against
the target under current launch conditions.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/radar_screen_heat_missile_lock.jpg" alt="radar_screen_heat_missile_lock" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The AIM-9 does not receive a guidance handoff from the APQ-120 like on
later aircraft to direct the seeker's look angle. Instead, the ASE circle
presents the aim dot against the target to bring it to the RBL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Centering the aim dot in the ASE aligns the target to the RBL, thus allowing for
rapid acquisition by the seeker of the selected AIM-9. Once the missile's tone
changes to signify lock, the pilot can then hold down the ARR button on the grip
to allow for Sidewinder self-track (seeker uncage); this function allows the
seeker to maintain acquisition of the target (noted by the shifted audio tone),
while permitting maneuver of the aircraft to a better aspect angle or range
solution prior to launch if the situation allows. The amount of maneuver
available to a given Sidewinder type is based on the variant, and should be
considered before making the selection.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/agm45.jpg" alt="agm45" /></p>
<p>The Sparrow-derived AGM-45 Shrike is an early attempt at an anti-radiation missile for the
suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) role. Mating a frequency-tuned seeker with the rocket body
of an AIM-7, the Shrike provided the United States Navy, and later the United States Air Force, with
a standoff option for the engagement of enemy SAM radars. While nominally effective, in practice the
Shrike was a difficult weapon to employ properly, given its limited range, low speed, and primary
engagement mode that left the launching aircraft within lethal envelopes of most opposing air
defense systems. Further reducing its potency was a small warhead, meaning that in most instances
only the emitting antenna itself was damaged, rather than the vehicle it was mounted to.</p>
<p>While limited in most respects, the Shrike received a number of upgrades over its lifetime, lasting
in service from the mid-60s in Vietnam, until just after the Gulf War, through better engines and
additional seeker updates for later SAM systems. The Shrike was put into use by two foreign users -
the Israeli Air Force, who also modified it for a ground-launched version, and through clandestine
means with the RAF during the Falklands War.</p>

<p>Only the A version can be equipped on this version of the Phantom.</p>
<h2 id="employment-3"><a class="header" href="#employment-3">Employment</a></h2>
<p>The AGM-45 has three separate launch modes available: (WRCS) AGM-45, (LABS) LOFT, and (WRCS) DIRECT.</p>
<h3 id="basic-cockpit-setup"><a class="header" href="#basic-cockpit-setup">Basic cockpit setup</a></h3>
<p>Before any AGM-45 Shrike can be employed a few things have to be set in the cockpit by the pilot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the station for the Shrike you want to employ via the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">station select buttons</a></li>

<li>(optional) Turn the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#navigation-function-selector-panel">flight director</a>
on for ADI needle guidance</li>
<li>(optional) Turn the LCOSS to A/G</li>
<li>Turn <a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">MASTER ARM</a> on</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="agm-45-wrcs-mode"><a class="header" href="#agm-45-wrcs-mode">AGM-45 (WRCS Mode)</a></h3>
<p>Used only with the AGM-45 in conjunction with the WRCS, this mode is the primary means of employment
of the Shrike. The mode is based around a high altitude attack profile, and depends on the
pre-programmed weapon engagement envelope of the AGM-45 stored within the WRCS. This profile, in
conjunction with current aircraft state information from the INS and a signal provided by the
receiver in the missile - having detecting an emitter of the type its attuned to, define a flight
path and release envelope for optimum probability of the missile reaching the target.</p>
<p>With the WRCS mode selected to AGM-45, the run is initiated by arming a station select button for a
hardpoint carrying an AGM-45 missile. Doing so activates the missile's receiver, and upon emitter
acquisition will provide the aforementioned information signal to the WRCS. The WSO should enter a
target altitude value into the computer control panel, if necessary, using a mean value for the
current target area, and if multiple missiles are to be launched, a release advance time setting.
The WRCS receives both data from the missile regarding look angle from the missile, along with
corrected look angle from the INS; the selection for which data to use is performed with the TGT/MSL
Rej switch, that should, in most cases, be left in the DF REJ position.</p>
<p>Look angle and estimated range available, the WRCS will provide guidance instruction using the
needles on the ADI. Once oriented in the dive angle, the horizontal range to target will be provided
on the HSI and BDHI, so long as the INS position is selected for navigation mode.</p>
<p>When the aircraft's orientation is correct and the ADI needles are centered, once the aircraft is
within missile range, one of the indexer lights will illuminate based on the detected range to
target to instruct the pilot as to the required release maneuver - dive, level, or pull-up. At this
time, the pilot can press and hold the bomb release button to initiate the attack. Once the release
range is attained in the instructed profile, the missile will be launched.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Special note must be made of the importance of maintaining the ADI needles centered, especially
the vertical azimuth relationship. Because the orientation of the missile itself when installed on
the wing can cause offset of its receiver to occur when the aircraft is banked, preparation of the
attack may require repeated adjustments with wings brought to level every few seconds to make
certain the aircraft is pointing at the emitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/agm_45_commands.jpg" alt="agm_45_commands" /> <em>Commands of the AGM-45 Shrike in WRCS mode</em></p>
<h4 id="pull-up"><a class="header" href="#pull-up">Pull-up</a></h4>
<p>The Pull-up command light indicates that the aircraft is at some range where the Pull-up maneuver
must be flown to get a release signal. After pickle and with the indexer light indicating Pull-up,
the Pull-up instruction is guidance for the pilot to initiate a steady rotation back to the horizon,
and, if desired, continue into a steady climb state until range requirements are met and the missile
is launched. The pilot can choose to either bring the aircraft to near level and stop, or pull
further into a low climb profile. When the aircraft is approximately 5 seconds away from release,
the level indicator will illuminate, directing the pilot to maintain the current orientation until
the Shrike is away.</p>
<h4 id="dive"><a class="header" href="#dive">Dive</a></h4>
<p>The dive command in the WRCS mode occurs only when the attack is initiated very close to the target.
The situation and proximity to the SAM installation must be considered prior to attack commitment
with the pickle button, as any response by the battery has a high probability of arriving before the
missile can potentially kill the emitter. The dive command, once followed, will then be followed
with the level indicator once missile launch imminent.</p>
<h4 id="level"><a class="header" href="#level">Level</a></h4>
<p>The level instruction is less of a directive than a confirmation of impending launch. Depending on
the initial attack setup, the level signal may immediately occur, or occur quite soon after one of
the other two instructions. From that point, it is simply required that the pilot maintain the
current state for best chance of missile success.</p>
<h4 id="wrcs-agm-45-employment"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-agm-45-employment">WRCS AGM-45 Employment</a></h4>
<p>To effectively employ the AGM-45 Shrike in WRCS mode, begin by selecting AGM-45 as the delivery mode
using the delivery mode knob. With the delivery mode configured, arm the hardpoint carrying the
Shrike missile by pressing the corresponding Station Select Button. This action activates the
missile’s onboard receiver, which begins scanning for emitters that match its pre-programmed
parameters.</p>
<p>Once the missile’s receiver detects a matching emitter, the WRCS begins calculating the optimal
flight path and release envelope. This process relies on real-time data from the missile’s receiver
and the aircraft’s INS, ensuring precise guidance. Confirm that emitter lock has been achieved by
checking the relevant cockpit indicators before proceeding with the attack.</p>
<p>Follow the WRCS-provided guidance carefully, using the ADI needles to adjust your orientation and
the HSI and BDHI to monitor horizontal range to the target. As the aircraft aligns with the
calculated trajectory, watch for one of the indexer lights to illuminate. Each light corresponds to
a specific release maneuver:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the Pull-up Light illuminates, begin a steady pull-up maneuver to meet the release parameters.
Rotate the aircraft smoothly back toward the horizon and, if necessary, continue into a shallow
climb profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Dive Light illuminates, initiate a controlled dive toward the target. This typically occurs
when the attack is initiated close to the target, so ensure you are prepared to commit quickly, as
proximity to the emitter increases the risk of enemy retaliation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Level Light indicates that the aircraft is in the correct orientation for missile release. In
some cases, this light may illuminate immediately or shortly after another maneuver, confirming
that you are ready for launch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the conditions are correct and the indexer light confirms the appropriate release profile,
press and hold the Bomb Release Button to initiate the missile launch sequence. Maintain the
aircraft’s orientation as instructed until the Shrike is released from the hardpoint.</p>
<p>One key consideration when employing the Shrike is that its success depends on the emitter remaining
active. If the target emitter ceases operation, the missile may lose guidance and fail to reach its
target. As such, timing and situational awareness are essential, especially when multiple missiles
are deployed.</p>
<h3 id="loft"><a class="header" href="#loft">Loft</a></h3>
<p>The Loft attack profile of the Shrike is like a loft bombing attack, utilizing the weapon lookup
tables to define a suitable IP to release distance, the necessary release angle, and the time from
IP to pull-up is determined by the lookup table speed versus the IP to release distance.</p>
<p>One key difference in the Loft mode versus the WRCS employment modes for the Shrike is the primary
usage of the NORM mode rather than DF REJ; this places the missile's receiver in the role of the
azimuth guidance directive on the ADI rather than the INS. The ADI's vertical needle will appear
when the AGM-45 position is selected on the pedestal switch which is the NORM position.</p>
<p>The attack is performed like a loft bombing profile; the Phantom is flown over the IP at the
intended altitude and airspeed, with the bomb release button being held from the point of flyover.
The countdown timer initiates, the horizontal ADI bar appears to maintain level flight, and the
pull-up lamp illuminates. When the pull-up timer runs out, the pull-up lamp will turn off, the sight
reticle will turn off, and the horizontal ADI bar will move to display G load as normal for the
pull-up maneuver; a correct profile will keep both ADI bars centered. When the aircraft achieves the
programmed release angle, the missile will launch. Once launch has occurred, the pull-up lamp and
sight reticle will illuminate again, and the horizontal ADI bar will stow.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/loft.jpg" alt="manual_loft_bombing" /> <em>Example of the Loft bombing, the procedure stays the
same for the AGM-45 Shrike</em></p>
<h4 id="labs-loft-employment"><a class="header" href="#labs-loft-employment">LABS Loft Employment</a></h4>
<p>This mode works exactly the same as it would for bombs so pre-planning is necessary. Select an IP
calculate the timers and fly the same attack profile as for Loft bombing. Note that in this mode the
sensor of the AGM-45 Shrike needs to sense a differential pressure of 1 psi and needs to sense
a barometric height below 18,000ft to arm itself and start guidance.</p>
<h3 id="direct-mode"><a class="header" href="#direct-mode">Direct Mode</a></h3>
<p>Direct mode employment of the AGM-45 is dependent on the crew knowing the precise location of the
target SAM emitter; while it can be utilized as a fallback method in event of a WRCS system failure,
the need for at least 10 degrees of dive angle against the target for successful delivery places a
premium on being able to plan the attack against a specific point on the ground.</p>
<p>To employ the weapon in Direct mode, the crew confirms receipt of emitter audio, and initiates a
dive to center the ADI needles at the target. The crew should then check the dive chart for angle
and AGL, and the pilot should maneuver into that orientation, maintaining a centered vertical ADI
needle. From that point, the bomb release button is pressed and held until the Shrike is fired.</p>
<h4 id="wrcs-direct-employment"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-direct-employment">WRCS Direct Employment</a></h4>
<p>For a direct employment all the pilot has to do is center the needles on the ADI and press the bomb
release button. The Shrike will fire within one second after pressing the bomb release button. Be
aware that the Shrike will have the least amount of range in direct mode and should be fired very
near to the target. A dive angle of 20 degree or more is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="seeker-heads"><a class="header" href="#seeker-heads">Seeker Heads</a></h3>
<p>The AGM-45 has 10 seeker heads, which each target a specific emitter radio frequency, to select
from. This means some preparation is required prior to flight in order to be properly prepared to
engage the threats effectively. The following seeker heads tables are provided so your missions can
be planned accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/agm65.jpg" alt="agm65" /></p>
<p>Entering service in 1972, the AGM-65 air to surface missile provided the Phantom
II with a direct-fire long range weapon, capable of destroying armor, mechanized
infantry, and other targets with electro-optical, and later - infrared imaged,
accuracy.</p>
<p>The F-4E was capable of carrying up to six between the two inboard wing pylons.
The AGM-65 Maverick has an approximate maximum range of 12 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Employment of the Maverick is shared between both cockpits, with the pilot
responsible for stores and mode selection, and initial seeker placement. From
the point the seeker head is stabilized on the intended target area, either crew
member can direct the final intended contrast target.</p>
<h2 id="variants-3"><a class="header" href="#variants-3">Variants</a></h2>
<p>Available variants include:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th style="text-align: right">Warhead</th><th>Field Of View</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<h2 id="employment-4"><a class="header" href="#employment-4">Employment</a></h2>
<p>To utilize a Maverick of any variant, the pilot begins by pressing the
applicable Station Select buttons, and setting Master Arm to On. The pilot then
must select Direct on the Delivery Mode Knob, and the TV position on the Weapon
Select Knob.</p>
<p>When selected to TV, the 3-minute missile gyro warmup sequence initiates; it is
suggested to start the stopwatch to the left of the Multiple Weapon Panel as a
means to avoid disturbing this sequence. Once the warmup has completed, the
lower amber ARM indicators on the Station Select buttons will illuminate.
Failure to permit this gyro cycle can potentially damage the guidance unit of
the missiles aboard. During this warmup period, it is helpful to set the optical
sight to A/G mode, and enter a depression of <strong>45 mils</strong>, so that the sight
alignment be that of the missile seeker. This way, the pilot can put the target
on the pipper and it will be within the weapons view.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>No Lock</th><th>Locked on Target</th><th>Narrow View and Locked</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<p>Once the warmup has completed, the crew may activate their displays for viewing
seeker video; the pilot selects the TV position on the Scope Display Select
switch on the Pedestal panel, and the WSO places the DSCG display mode knob to
TV and the Video Select Switch to WEAPON instead of ASQ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To start the TV feed, the flight stick trigger has to be pressed, otherwise
the screen stays blank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the displays activated, the pilot maneuvers the aircraft to position the
sight reticle over the target area, and either crew member can then press their
respective flight stick trigger to initiate video. With video active, command of
the missile seeker is controlled by the crew member who activated the video
signal, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="pilot"><a class="header" href="#pilot">Pilot</a></h3>
<p>With the pipper over the target area, pressing and holding the ARR button
enables track slewing with the Forward Hand Control stick inboard from the
throttle. Once the seeker crosshair is over the intended target, releasing the
ARR button performs a lock-on of the missile to the contrast area under the
crosshair. If the missile seeker fails to achieve lock on the correct target,
the lock can be broken by squeezing the trigger again, bringing the missile
seeker back to its boresight position, and then reattempting the lock with the
ARR button. Should the target not appear to have enough contrast versus the
surrounding background, the contrast can be swapped from black hot to white-hot,
or vice versa, using the Target Contrast Switch on the inboard Engine Control
Panel. Leaving the switch in the Auto position allows the seeker to attempt to
determine the best option for contrast.</p>
<p>Should a missile appear to not be functioning correctly, it can be rejected to
the next round in the release sequence using the TGT/MSL REJ switch.</p>
<p>Once lock on the correct target is attained, the missile is launched using the
bomb button. To initiate lock on of the next target, the process is started over
with the squeezing of the trigger.</p>
<p>With the above in mind for the electro-optical AGM-65A and B, the AGM-65D has a
few minor alterations to the procedure. The seeker of the 65D has two FOV
settings, wide and narrow, and initial video signal is provided in the wide
setting. In this setting, a quartet of L shaped brackets define the region of
the display that will be zoomed in upon selecting the narrow field of view.
Pressing the trigger a second time changes the video to the narrow setting,
allowing for a more precise selection of the target.</p>
<h3 id="wso"><a class="header" href="#wso">WSO</a></h3>
<p>The WSO performs the same sequence of actions for the seeker guidance, and can
initiate video upon pilot confirmation of pipper location using the trigger of
his own flight stick in the rear cockpit. From this point, the WSO uses the
antenna hand control stick to manage the seeker head placement, lock, and in the
case of AGM-65D employment FoV controls. Rather than pressing and holding the
ARR button to activate slew, the WSO selects the half-action trigger position,
and then slews the seeker using the cursor control.</p>
<p>Once the applicable target is under the crosshair, lock is achieved using the
full action command. Should the WSO need to change 65D FoV to narrow, a
subsequent press of half action will do so. The WSO can change the contrast mode
with the Contrast Switch on RWR Panel on the right side. And, once lock is
achieved, the WSO can fire the missile using the Missile Launch button found on
his flight stick - in the same position as the Bomb Release button on the front
stick.</p>

<p>The AGM-12, nicknamed Bullpup, is a guided short-range air-to-ground missile
that can be steered manually by the crew.</p>
<p>Steering commands are send via radio by utilizing the lower UHF antenna of the
Phantom.</p>
<p>It was the first of its kind that reached series production and was used in
service during the early 1960s until it was later supplanted by the

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/ext_f4_rockets.jpg" alt="lau3" /></p>
<p>Also known as the Mighty Mouse, the Mk 4 series of unguided aerial rockets
originated as an air-to-air weapon. Given the rocket's undirected nature,
tendency for wide dispersion in salvo usage, and overall poor performance in its
intended role - most notably an incident in which over 200 rounds were fired by
a pair of F-89 Scorpions in a failed attempt to down an un-commanded target
drone, the Mighty Mouse was wholly unfit for purpose. However, the rocket's
peculiar traits were ingeniously capitalized upon by transitioning it to the
role of an air to ground area effect weapon.</p>
<p>Having become a useful tool, the original Mk 4's capability was expanded upon
with a wide array of warheads, including smoke, anti-personnel flechette, and
those used by the USAF on the Phantom - the M156 White Phosphorous, Mk 1 High
Explosive, and the Mk 5 High Explosive Anti Tank. Depending on the hardpoint
location and configuration, up to 3 LAU-3 pod launchers can be installed per
hardpoint, each carrying 19 FFARs.</p>

<p>The Phantom II's bread and butter in the air to ground role, the Mk 80 series
conventional bombs were first dropped in combat over North Vietnam. The F-4E is
able to deliver the 500 lb Mk 82, the 1000 lb Mk 83, and 2000 lb Mk 84. Of note
is the selectable drag option Mk 82 variant known as Snakeye. With the
selectable fin arrangement on the round, the deployable fins remain in position
in the low drag profile, and deploy as a cruciform aerobraking device in the
high drag setting. This change in setting is managed with the Nose/Tail Arming
switch.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II was equipped with TV-guided bombs, notably the GBU-8 and
AGM-62 Walleye, enhancing its precision strike capabilities.</p>
<p>The GBU-8, also known as the "HOBOS" (Homing Bomb System), its successor the
GBU-15, and the AGM-62 I and II Walleye are electro-optical, TV-guided glide
bombs. They are precision-guided munition equipped with a television camera in
their nose.</p>
<p>The GBU-15 can be steered after being launched via a data-link interface,
leading to pinpoint precision and increasing the F-4E's effectiveness in
attacking well-defended and high-value targets, providing a "man-in-the-loop"
guidance solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The earlier DSCG variant does not support the data-link interface. Thus, it
can launch the weapons only in a backup mode <em>"Lock-On Before Launch"</em> similar
to Mavericks, without any manual steering after launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, also both Walleye variants received data-link upgrades (ER/DL).
However, the F-4E has never been adjusted to support the Walleyes specific
data-link interface for man-in-the-loop guidance.</p>
<p>Both the GBU-8/15 and AGM-62 Walleye were crucial additions to the F-4E's

<h2 id="dive-toss---dt"><a class="header" href="#dive-toss---dt">Dive Toss - DT</a></h2>
<p>One of the most accurate and easiest bombing modes to use is Dive Toss.</p>
<p>It requires a direct line of sight and computing the right drag coefficient
value for the WRCS.</p>
<p>The pilot flies a dive attack on the target while the WSO obtains accurate
target range information using the radar. Once the target is designated, the
pilot simple holds down the Bomb Button and begins to gently pull out of the
dive. Weapons automatically release at the right moment during the maneuver.</p>
<p>Dive Toss uses the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> and
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> tracking, in conjunction with
other aircraft sensors, to calculate the release solution in real time. The
target can be approached from any direction, airspeed, and dive angle, and the
WRCS computes the proper release point relative to the acquired track, munition
drag coefficient setting, and any release advance control input (in conjunction
with <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a> settings).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Since for a lot of dive attack profiles the drag coefficient value barely
changes (e.g. dropping conventional bombs from medium altitude, high speed and
steep angles), Dive Toss can be a very forgiving mode that is suitable to be
used against targets of opportunity with little setup or planning.</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Tool</a> can be used
to compute the appropriate Drag Coefficient value.</p>

<h3 id="procedure"><a class="header" href="#procedure">Procedure</a></h3>
<p>To perform a Dive Toss attack, the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> must be set in AIR-GRD mode, with
a 5 or 10-mile range setting. Once set, the pilot initiates the attack with the
Optical Sight in Air-to-Ground mode, and the reticle automatically cages in
elevation along the RBL. The pilot then selects DT on the Delivery Mode Knob,
places Weapon Selector Knob in BOMBS, and selects the desired Interval and
Quantity on the respective <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>
knobs. At this point, the pilot can initiate the attack.</p>
<p>The attack is initiated in a dive. The required dive is roughly 20% higher than
that required for a Direct mode attack, as to achieve effective
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> ground lock; that is, the radar
must get a solid ground return, rather than see the actual target being bombed.
Once lock-on is achieved, the pilot then maneuvers to place the pipper over the
intended target, wings level, then presses and holds the bomb button to insert
radar range to the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>, and then
begins the desired pullout maneuver, maintaining wings level. After the pilot
pushes the bomb release button, radar ground lock is no longer required. The
pullout maneuver must maintain as constant a rate of turn as possible for
maximum precision.</p>
<p>At the point where the bomb computed trajectory will intersect the target, the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> provides the release signal,
dropping rounds based on the settings chosen for number and interval.</p>
<h2 id="target-find---tgt-find"><a class="header" href="#target-find---tgt-find">Target Find - TGT FIND</a></h2>
<p>Target Find was originally just a utility mode derived from OFFSET mode; where
it does not provide a standard release signal to the fire control and
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a> to initiate bomb drop, but
was instead used to confirm target location without release, for training
purposes, or, if necessary, perform an <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a>
system update.</p>
<p>However, with the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/overview.html">Pave Spike</a>
targeting pod installed, Target Find will instead signal the WRCS to use the
target defined by the pods line of sight for a Dive Toss delivery, instead of
defining the target by radar lock.</p>
<p>In this case, the Pave Spike is placed on the target (activate the laser for a
more accurate slant range) and the bomb button is pressed and hold down. Similar
to a regular Dive Toss delivery, steering cues appear on the HUD. The system
will automatically release the bombs when the parameters for the ballistic
solution are met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡It is not necessary to perform a dive maneuver as the target is simply
designated by the pods line of sight together with the measured slant range
instead of the radar.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 TGT FIND with the Pave Spike is comparable to CCRP modes in newer aircraft.
Designate the target with the pod, hold down the bomb button and weapons
automatically release at the right moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="offset-delivery---offset"><a class="header" href="#offset-delivery---offset">Offset Delivery - OFFSET</a></h1>
<p>Offset bombing provides a blind bombing capability, with high and low level
bombing profiles, using the full integration of the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>,
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a>, and
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> in combination. Offset bombing
can be used in both visual and instrument conditions, to release either bombs or
dispensed munitions (with the RKTS &amp; DISP mode).</p>
<p>The crew chooses a known reference point (IP) and obtains target position by a
means of an offset to that reference point. After setting up the aircraft with
the corresponding values, the attack is then flown by designating the reference
point instead of the actual target. The aircraft can then automatically release
weapons based on the offset values.</p>
<h2 id="identification-point"><a class="header" href="#identification-point">Identification Point</a></h2>
<p>The setup for an Offset bomb attack is based around the selection of an IP
relative to a known target location. For a visual attack, it is called VIP - the
Visual Identification Point, and initiation of the navigation assistance is
performed with a direct flyover of the VIP.</p>
<p>In an instrument conditions attack, the IP is called the RIP - the Radar
Identification Point, and acquisition of this point using a radar lock in
MAP-PPI mode generates a navigation solution to the target.</p>
<p>When chosen during planning, the VIP or RIP's position relative to the target
determines a pair of offset values (hence the name of the mode); one in the
North/South axis, the other East/West. Both offsets are noted in feet, and the
maximum amount of offset in each axis is 99,900', or 16.44 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Also found during mission planning is the altitude of the IP, and selection is
made using the lookup tables for the respective weapon, altitude above target,
and speed, taking note of the bomb range. When preparing the WRCS entries, the
offsets are always referenced from the IP to the target. Selection of an IP
should be as close as possible to the target to minimize system drift by way of
smaller navigation time and distance, and approach to the IP should be flown
with a focus on minimizing maneuvering required to put the target nose on after
IP acquisition (RIP) or flyover (VIP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Tool</a> can be
used to convert offset values from direct range and direction to the required
N/S and E/W distances.</p>

<h3 id="rip-low-altitude-considerations"><a class="header" href="#rip-low-altitude-considerations">RIP Low Altitude Considerations</a></h3>
<p>Of special note in the RIP mode is the need to compensate for altitude
difference in the event the ingress to target will be flown below the altitude
of the RIP itself. Because the computations performed by the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> and navigation system are
mechanical, selecting a RIP target altitude above the course can cause
interference damage. To alleviate this, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Note the approach altitude above MSL.</li>
<li>Subtract the approach altitude MSL from the RIP altitude above MSL.</li>
<li>Subtract the resulting value found in 2. from the approach altitude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting value is used for the target altitude value, and the pilot flies
the planned approach attitude during the target freeze and insert operations as
per normal.</p>
<h2 id="procedure-1"><a class="header" href="#procedure-1">Procedure</a></h2>
<h3 id="visual-ip"><a class="header" href="#visual-ip">Visual IP</a></h3>
<p>Prior to IP overflight, the N/S and E/W offsets, release range (x10 per the
window, or using the x100 switch modifier on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> initiate panel), and any
desired release advance setting should be entered. Additionally, the desired
release timing and count should be selected on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>.</p>
<p>The Offset Visual IP attack commences on overflight of the VIP, with the
aircraft at the desired release altitude and speed; as the aircraft overflies
the VIP, the WSO simultaneously presses the Freeze Signal and Target Insert
Signal buttons on the Cursor Control Panel; doing so initiates
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> target tracking. At this time, the
vertical
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>,
Sight,
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>,
and
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#horizontal-situation-indicator">HSI</a>
navigation aids will all show offset from the calculated release point, as well
as target range on the HSI and BDHI.</p>
<p>Completion of the attack is performed by the pilot through maneuvering the
aircraft to align course to the release point, maintaining the planned release
airspeed and altitude, and, prior to reaching the release point, pressing and
holding the bomb release button. If the bomb release button is released prior to
munitions release, but at a range greater than the programmed release range, the
attack can be recovered by pressing and holding the bomb release button until
release occurs. When this takes place, the pull-up light will illuminate to
confirm drop initiation. Should the bomb release button not be pressed until
after the release point is passed, the bombs will not release until the target
is passed; ergo, the bomb button should be released to cancel the run prior to
errant bomb drop.</p>
<p>Once an attack is completed, the navigation program against the set target is
maintained. The aircraft can attempt a re-attack, although natural INS drift may
reduce the accuracy of this second attack.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../img/offsetvip.jpg" alt="Offset Visual IP" /></p>
<h2 id="radar-ip"><a class="header" href="#radar-ip">Radar IP</a></h2>
<p>Prior to RIP Freeze and Target Insert, the N/S and E/W offsets, RIP altitude,
release range (x10 per the window, or using the x100 switch modifier on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> initiate panel), and any
desired release advance setting should be entered. Additionally, the desired
release timing and count should be selected on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>. Prior to initiation, the
pilot should enter the target area at the desired profile altitude and airspeed.
The WSO should have the APQ-120 prepared for the attack with a good
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> picture in MAP-PPI mode, NOR stab
mode, WIDE scan, and a range of 10 or 25 miles, with an observed return from the
RIP.</p>
<p>Initiation of the attack begins with placing the Along Track cursor (presented
as a growing hemisphere on the radar display defining range to the RIP) in
proximity to, but below, the intended RIP return. When this is set, the Cross
Track cursor (a vertical line) is slewed over the RIP. Once the intersection is
defined, the WSO waits momentarily until the RIP range decreases and falls onto
the intersection. At this time, the WSO pushes the Freeze button. This initiates
radar tracking of the RIP, and provides the opportunity for the WSO to better
the intersection point between the Along Track and Cross Track cursors. Once the
precise point is attained, the WSO pushes the Insert Target button, which hands
target guidance off to the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> and
performs an immediate slew of the Along Track and Cross Track cursors from the
RIP to the offset target.</p>
<p>At this time, the INS presents guidance and range information on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>,
the sight, the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>,
and the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#horizontal-situation-indicator">HSI</a>.
The WSO should continue to monitor the radar display - should the actual target
appear on the display as range decreases, the actual known altitude of the
target can be entered on the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>
panel and the Along Track and Cross Track cursors can be touched up using their
controls to further increase release precision.</p>
<p>Prior to release range, the pilot must press and hold the bomb release button.
Once the bombs have released, the pull-up light will illuminate to confirm
release.</p>
<p>In the event that a RIP profile, due to breaking weather conditions, transition
to a VIP-possible profile, the offsets can be kept in the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>, and the pilot simply fly
over the RIP, with the WSO pressing the Freeze and Target Insert buttons
simultaneously, just like a VIP attack.</p>

<p>If no <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/overview.html">Pave Spike</a>
targeting pod is installed, the TGT FIND mode can be used as a practice mode for
OFFSET.</p>
<p>It then functions identical to the OFFSET mode with the difference of not
sending an actual release signal to the weapons.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="level-release"><a class="header" href="#level-release">Level Release</a></h1>
<p>Multiple modes can be used to release bombs from level flight. This chapter
focuses on the TL mode. See the other sections for level release from DIRECT,
TGT FIND, OFFSET or L modes.</p>
<h2 id="timed-level---tl"><a class="header" href="#timed-level---tl">Timed Level - TL</a></h2>
<p>Timed Level bombing is the most basic
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a> mode, utilizing only the
Release Timer.</p>
<p>Once the Bomb Button is pressed and hold down, the timer counts down. As soon as
it reaches zero, weapons are deployed.</p>
<p>Because it is so simple, it can be utilized for attacks from high altitude that
do not require to be accurate, dropping bombs safely from above cloud cover.</p>
<h3 id="procedure-2"><a class="header" href="#procedure-2">Procedure</a></h3>
<p>The setting for the Release Timer is found based on the bomb range value
determined for the chosen weapon, referencing the desired flight altitude above
the target and airspeed. This range determines the point where the munition(s)
will be released from the aircraft. An IP is chosen relative to the bomb range
distance, and the Release timer value is then calculated using the distance
between the point of release and the IP based on the chosen airspeed.</p>
<p>The pull-up timer should be set to 000, and the High and Low Release settings
can be left at any value.</p>
<p>The attack is performed by entering the necessary Release Timer value, pushing
and holding the bomb release button upon IP flyover, and maintaining straight
and level flight at the planned airspeed and altitude at the target until the
weapons are released from the aircraft. Unlike the other LABS modes, there is no
pull-up audio or
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
needle takeover to illustrate pitch or roll deviation- it is simply dependent on
the pilot to maintain wings level flight.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="laydown-modes"><a class="header" href="#laydown-modes">Laydown Modes</a></h1>
<p>Laydown delivery allows for releasing weapons from a wings level attitude by
designating the target visually either by using the pipper set to a certain
sight depression or the radar.</p>
<p>They are most effective if used for low altitude attacks, as well as deploying
CBUs or high drag bombs.</p>
<h2 id="laydown---l"><a class="header" href="#laydown---l">Laydown - L</a></h2>
<p>In this mode, the target is designated by means of a distance to a point prior
to the target (IP). Once over that point, the Bomb Button is held down and
weapons automatically release after passing the setup release range.</p>
<p>As a visual aid, the sight should be depressed in a way that it will be exactly
over the target when at the IP. That way, as soon as the pipper is over the
target, the Bomb Button can be held down and weapons will impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The correct sight depression can be computed using the

<h3 id="procedure---l"><a class="header" href="#procedure---l">Procedure - L</a></h3>
<p>Setup for the Laydown attack requires the bombing table target range and
altitude above target to be entered on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel.</p>
<p>The Optical Sight should be set to the depression noted from the tables in
Air-to-Ground mode, and the approach to the target should be flown at the true
airspeed (or ground speed) listed in the bombing tables for the parameters,
wings level</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a> and WRCS Release Advance
settings should be entered as desired, and the Weapon Select Knob placed in
BOMBS or RKTS &amp; DISP (for dispensers like CBU-1 and CBU-2 only).</p>
<p>As the pipper crosses the target, the bomb button should be held until the set
spread of munitions has released.</p>
<h2 id="dive-laydown---dl"><a class="header" href="#dive-laydown---dl">Dive Laydown - DL</a></h2>
<p>This mode is a variation of the regular Laydown mode, where the target is
designated by using the radar instead.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pilot flies a dive attack similar to the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/accurate_modes.html#dive-toss---dt">Dive Toss</a> mode, while the WSO obtains
accurate range information to the target by obtaining a radar lock.</p>
<p>After target designation, the pilot levels out at the planned altitude and
weapons release automatically at the set range to the target.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../img/divelaydown.jpg" alt="Dive Laydown" /></p>
<h3 id="procedure---dl"><a class="header" href="#procedure---dl">Procedure - DL</a></h3>
<p>The bombing table release range must be set directly in the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel, and the pilot flies
the ballistic schedule speed (true airspeed or ground speed) at the given
altitude above the target to produce the given release range.</p>
<p>Dive Laydown is selected by placing the Delivery Mode Knob in DL, and choosing
either RKTS &amp; DISP (for dispensers like CBU-1 or CBU-2 only) or BOMBS. Desired
release range is entered on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel, and, if necessary, the
release advance control.</p>
<p>The start of the attack is the same as Dive Toss; a higher than normal dive
angle is flown, with the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/radar/overview.html">radar</a> in
AIR-GRD mode at 5 or 10-mile range, a solid return is generated, and the pilot
then positions the pipper on the intended target and holds the bomb release
button.</p>
<p>Once this is completed, the pilot pulls out of the dive at the bombing table
plan altitude, maintains the target speed and heading with wings level, and the
bombs release automatically at the desired range.</p>
<p>The key factors for accuracy in this mode are correct altitude and pitch angle
at the point of release.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lofting-and-tossing"><a class="header" href="#lofting-and-tossing">Lofting and Tossing</a></h1>
<p>The Phantom supports a variety of ways to loft and toss bombs on targets with
minimum expose to ground fire while sacrificing accuracy.</p>
<p>These modes are mostly designed to be used with nuclear weapons, but can also be
used effectively with conventional bombs when employing a high amount of
ammunition while attacking a larger area target.</p>
<p>They are categorized into either lofting or tossing modes.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Modes</th><th>Release Angle</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Lofting</td><td>LOFT, T LAD</td><td>below 90°</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tossing</td><td>O/S, INST O/S</td><td>above 90°</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The benefit of lofting is that target flyover can be avoided, greatly minimizing
the risk of getting attacked. Weapons can be dispensed from great distances,
allowing the aircraft to turn around before entering the dangerous zone.</p>
<p>If target flyover is possible, tossing modes allow for more accuracy by
designating the target visually by initiating the maneuver over the target area.
The advantage compared to other visual release modes is that the time until
weapon impact is greatly increased, allowing the aircraft to gain some distance
before impact. This is crucial when employing nuclear weapons.</p>
<h2 id="loft-1"><a class="header" href="#loft-1">LOFT</a></h2>
<p>As the name entails, the aircraft transitions from a low altitude to a higher
one in a pull-up, thus lofting the released munitions at a pre-calculated point
that reaches the target.</p>
<p>The mode revolves around computing and setting a pull-up timer based on the
desired release parameters, such as altitude, speed and loft angle.</p>
<p>The pilot flies to the reference point, holds the bomb button and starts
initiating the pull-up maneuver the moment the aircraft gives the pull-up cue.
Weapons automatically release when reaching the setup loft angle.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../img/loft.jpg" alt="loft" /></p>
<h3 id="procedure---loft"><a class="header" href="#procedure---loft">Procedure - LOFT</a></h3>
<p>Planning for a loft attack requires a known target location, so that distances
for the IP and respective bomb ranges can be calculated. The ballistics tables
are references to determine delivery pattern and pull-up-to-target range.</p>
<p>With this information, the number of bombs can be decided, which determines the
spread, and knowing the pull-up to target range - the pull-up point distance to
the IP can be chosen.</p>
<p>As the path from IP to pull-up is flown at a constant speed, this can then be
used to determined time from said distance for pull-up Timer entry. And with the
ballistic table reference for the LOW angle, the profile is set.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Tool</a> can be
used to compute the proper value for the Pull-Up Timer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon entry to the target area, the pilot flies the intended course to the IP,
and once over, presses and holds the bomb release button to initiate the run.
Flying direct or crabbed to the pull-up point, the pilot maintains the bomb
release button in the down position, and holds it until the desired munitions
have released.</p>
<p>In LOFT mode, the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a> programs
for a <strong>4 G pull-up schedule</strong>, and will automatically release the selected
munitions once the bombing run is initiated, timer runout has occurred, and
pre-set LOW pitch (gyro) angle is achieved.</p>
<p>At the initiation of the bomb run, upon pressing the bomb button, the ARBCS
overrides any other navigational guidance provided on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
and assumes command of the pointers to show deviation relative to the programmed
attack profile. The vertical pointer offsets in the direction requiring yaw
input to maintain target alignment. On approach to the loft point, the
horizontal needle shows deviation from a 1.0 G flight path.</p>
<p>When the pull-up timer completes signaling the <strong>4 G pull-up</strong>, deviation of the
horizontal needle is relative to the desired constant 4 G pull, with the initial
drift representing achieving 4 G of load in two seconds. Maintaining the
horizontal needle centered means the pilot has increased and held G at the
proper rate for maximum accuracy. Control of the ADI by the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">AN/AJB-7</a> is maintained until the
pilot releases the bomb button after the last desired munition is released.</p>
<h2 id="timed-low-angle-drogue-delivery---t-ladd"><a class="header" href="#timed-low-angle-drogue-delivery---t-ladd">Timed Low Angle Drogue Delivery - T LAD(D)</a></h2>
<p>Conceived as a delivery method for tactical nuclear bombs, Timed Low Angle
Drogue Delivery is a variation of LOFT to maximize the time to impact by lofting
a bomb with drogue at maximum distance to the target.</p>
<p>The mode performs a low altitude ingress, transitioning through a 3.5 G pull-up
into a 45 degree climb profile that allows for a lofted release of a weapon at
the top of the climb, allowing an escape attempt as the munition's deployed
drogue slows the decent to the target. While originally designed with nuclear
intent, the method provides yet another option for accurate bomb delivery with a
high, or high to low, escape option for appropriate targets.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../img/ladd.jpg" alt="ladd" /></p>
<h3 id="procedure---t-ladd"><a class="header" href="#procedure---t-ladd">Procedure - T LAD(D)</a></h3>
<p>Planning of the T LADD engagement begins in the bombing tables, determining the

be used as the Release control timer value, as well as the distance downrange
this climb maneuver will take the aircraft.</p>
<p>Using this range as a baseline, an appropriate approach angle is determined, and
a suitable IP waypoint is chosen. The distance between the IP and the pull-up
point is evaluated against the planned profile speed, which provides another
time entry - this will be the pull-up timer value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Timer values can be obtained using the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Tool</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attack is performed by flying over the IP along the desired intercept
heading to the target at the correct speed and altitude, and actuating the bomb
release button upon flyover of said IP, holding it down throughout the maneuver.</p>
<p>This begins the pull-up timer. The
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
needles will center, then show deviation against the initial heading course -
vertical being roll, horizontal being level to maintain current altitude.</p>
<p>At timeout of the pull-up timer, a pull-up warning tone will be provided, and
the pull-up Lamp will illuminate; subsequently, the Release timer will begin its
count, the horizontal ADI needle will transition into show deviation from the
intended 3.5 G pitch angle, and then stabilize once <strong>45 degrees</strong> nose up pitch
is attained. Proper timing and loading of the <strong>3.5 G pull-up</strong> will maintain
the needle centered.</p>
<p>At timeout of the Release timer, the programmed munitions will release, the
pull-up light will turn off, and the ADI needles will be stowed. Once the last
round is ejected, the bomb release button can be released, and the desired
escape maneuver performed.</p>
<h2 id="timed-over-the-shoulder---os"><a class="header" href="#timed-over-the-shoulder---os">Timed Over the Shoulder - O/S</a></h2>
<p>Similar to LOFT, this mode allows deploying weapons based on a pull-up timer
that represents the distance from IP to target.</p>
<p>Weapons are released during a pull-up maneuver when reaching the setup release
angle. In this mode, release angles are beyond 90°; effectively tossing the
weapon over the shoulder, in contrast to lofting it ahead.</p>
<p>The mode revolves around computing and setting a pull-up timer based on the
desired release parameters, such as altitude, speed and toss angle.</p>
<p>The pilot then flies to the reference point, holds the bomb button and starts
initiating the pull-up maneuver the moment the aircraft gives the pull-up cue.
Weapons automatically release when reaching the setup toss angle.</p>
<h3 id="procedure---os"><a class="header" href="#procedure---os">Procedure - O/S</a></h3>
<p>Setup of the LABS system requires time (calculated using the known distance from
the set IP to the target flyover point and the intended airspeed) and calculated
release angle for the resulting airspeed and munition, which is entered into the
High Angle setting; this value must be in excess of 90 degrees, and the Low
Angle and secondary timer settings can be left at any value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The Pull-Up Timer value can be computed using the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Tool</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flying the appropriate heading at the correct speed guarantees target flyover,
and upon timer runout an audible tone will be heard to initiate pull-up, along
with the Pull-Up Lamp illuminating. This timing action is initiated by pressing
the bomb button over the IP, and holding it throughout the attack run.</p>
<p>Like LOFT mode, the pull-up signal indications will also trigger the horizontal
and vertical pointers on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
to display appropriate pitch and angle indications to maintain proper aircraft
orientation for accurate release point entry, and the <strong>target pull rate is 4
G</strong>. The guidance drives the attacking aircraft through an Immelmann, and the
bombs will release at the entered High Angle value.</p>
<p>Maximum accuracy is achieved through maintaining a centered horizontal needle
during the entire bombing run, and like LOFT, the ADI reverts back to the
previous function once the bomb button is released after the last intended
munition for the run has been dropped.</p>
<h2 id="instantaneous-over-the-shoulder---inst-os"><a class="header" href="#instantaneous-over-the-shoulder---inst-os">Instantaneous Over the Shoulder - INST O/S</a></h2>
<p>Further, derived from the Timed O/S mode, Instantaneous Over the Shoulder
bombing provides the same combined attack/escape profile as the former against
targets of opportunity.</p>
<p>In this mode, setting up an IP and a timer are not needed. Instead, the target
is designated by pressing the Bomb Button once over the target and executing the
pull-up maneuver shortly after.</p>
<h3 id="procedure---inst-os"><a class="header" href="#procedure---inst-os">Procedure - INST O/S</a></h3>
<p>Similar to Timed O/S, a desired release angle over 90° has to be configured.</p>
<p>Once the aircraft is directly over the target, the pilot presses and holds the
bomb release button and initiates the <strong>4 G wings level pull up</strong> into the
Immelmann maneuver.</p>
<p>The LABS computer performs the same
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
display overrides as Loft and Timed O/S, placing the horizontal director needle
at the pitch appropriate for a 4 G pull, and the vertical director displays
deviation to maintain proper angle of bank through the maneuver.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the necessary angle of pitch, the munitions separation begins, and
the bomb release button can be released once all desired rounds have been
ejected from the aircraft, thus resetting the display of the ADI.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="manual-release---direct"><a class="header" href="#manual-release---direct">Manual Release - DIRECT</a></h1>
<p>Direct bombing is exactly as it sounds: classic, direct visual bombing, with
both dive and level bombing release passes possible. Both the

<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/../../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS.</a> are excluded from this
release mode, and the pilot flies the profile as found for the intended munition
in the bombing tables, setting the sight depression to match, and hand flying
the aircraft to place the pipper directly onto the target in accordance with the
desired type of attack.</p>
<p>Once pipper on is achieved, the bomb release button is pressed, and the selected
number of munitions with the given program settings will be released.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="navigation"><a class="header" href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h1>
<p><img src="jester/../img/map_2.jpg" alt="real_life_crew_with_map" /></p>
<p>Navigation with Jester revolves around managing turn points for two flight
plans: the Primary Flight Plan and the Secondary Flight Plan. Both can be edited
and followed by Jester in the same manner, although Primary Flight Plan is
considered the main one and the Secondary Flight Plan serves as a backup.</p>
<h2 id="flight-plan"><a class="header" href="#flight-plan">Flight Plan</a></h2>
<p>A flight plan consists of waypoints. They can be inserted, deleted or edited by
the player through the UI, map or mission editor.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_edit_turn_points.jpg" alt="Edit Waypoints" /></p>
<p>If the mission has assigned the aircraft a series of waypoints through the
mission editor, this will be available by default as the Primary Flight Plan.</p>
<p>Each waypoint in the flight plan can be designated as one of several special
types. These designations will influence Jesters actions and the dialog phrases he uses
as one approach the waypoint. The types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Point (default)</strong>: This is the standard waypoint type. Jester will
automatically switch to the next waypoint when the aircraft is within 2
nautical miles (NM) of the turn point, as indicated by his BDHI.</li>
<li><strong>Nav Fix (VIP - Visual Identification Point)</strong>: Jester will perform an INS
(Inertial Navigation System) position update when flying over this point. He
will report the distance to the VIP 10NM and 5NM in advance. Before reaching
the VIP, Jester will input the necessary coordinates into the Navigation
Computer, set the Navigation Computer Position Update Switch to FIX, and then
execute the update when flying over the visual reference point. It is
important to note that the pilot must fly over the visual reference, not the
INS-indicated point. Jester will adjust the INS coordinates at the VIP, and
the success of the fix depends on how accurately the visual flyby matches the
reference point. Afterward, Jester will report whether the update was
successful or if the aircraft was too far from the point (in which case the
flyby must be repeated). Upon a successful fix, Jester will switch to the next
waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Point (IP)</strong>: Jester will report the distance to the IP (15NM, 10NM,
5NM, and 2NM in advance) and provide a reminder when the aircraft is within
2NM. Once past the IP, he will switch to the next waypoint.</li>
<li><strong>Target (TGT)</strong>: Similar to the IP, but with different phrases, suited target
area. Jester will update the pilot as the aircraft approaches the point (10NM,
5NM, and 2NM in advance), and switch to the next waypoint once past the
target.</li>
<li><strong>Fence In (F-IN)</strong> and <strong>Fence Out (F-OUT)</strong>: These waypoints function
similarly to the IP and Target types, but with additional tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Homebase (HB)</strong> and <strong>Alternate (ALT)</strong>: These are designated landing
points. Jester will not automatically switch to the next waypoint at these
points, and he will report as the aircraft approaches the Homebase.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Air Patrol (CAP)</strong>: The first waypoint designated as CAP will be saved
as <em>CAP1</em>, and the second will be saved as <em>CAP2</em>, regardless of their
positions in the flight plan. Jester will ask how long the pilot intends to
remain on station at <em>CAP1</em>. He will then cycle between <em>CAP1</em> and <em>CAP2</em>
until the designated CAP time expires, after which he will switch to the next
waypoint following <em>CAP2</em> in the flight plan. There can be several
<em>CAP1</em>-<em>CAP2</em> pairs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 For <em>Fence In</em> and <em>Fence Out</em>, Jester will later also guide the pilot
through specific checklists.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="map-marker"><a class="header" href="#map-marker">Map Marker</a></h3>
<p>Using the <kbd>F10</kbd> map view in DCS, players can create named markers on
the map simply by double clicking the desired position after selecting <strong>Mark
Label</strong> at the top row in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/dcs_map_markers.jpg" alt="Create Map Markers" /></p>
<p>Through the UI, these map markers can then be imported as turn points to the
flight plan.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_map_markers_ui.jpg" alt="Select Map Marker" /></p>
<h3 id="tune-asset"><a class="header" href="#tune-asset">Tune Asset</a></h3>
<p>The UI offers a list of nearby assets, such as ships, tankers or ground
stations.</p>
<p>Their current position can be imported as turn point directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 For moving assets like tankers, their actual position might vary from the
planned coordinates. Use TACAN or ADF for more precise navigation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tune-airfield"><a class="header" href="#tune-airfield">Tune Airfield</a></h3>
<p>Similar to tuning for assets, the UI provides a list of nearby airfields to
navigate to.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_tune_airfields.jpg" alt="Tune Airfields" /></p>
<h3 id="enter-coordinates"><a class="header" href="#enter-coordinates">Enter Coordinates</a></h3>
<p>One way to add a turn point is by entering the corresponding LAT/LON through the
UI.</p>
<p>The format is <code>H DD MM H DDD MM</code>,</p>
<ul>
<li>where <code>H</code> represents the hemisphere (<code>N</code> or <code>S</code> for latitude and <code>E</code> or <code>W</code>
for longitude);</li>
<li><code>D</code> signifies Degrees (<code>00</code> to <code>89</code> for latitude and <code>000</code> to <code>179</code> for
longitude);</li>
<li>and <code>M</code> stands for Minutes (<code>00</code> to <code>59</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>A valid example could be <code>N 45 32 E 047 12</code> or <code>S 05 55 W 105 00</code>.</p>

<h2 id="operation-1"><a class="header" href="#operation-1">Operation</a></h2>
<p>Jester navigates by utilizing a technique called <strong>leapfrogging</strong>. The aircraft
only provides a single slot to memorize a waypoint (called <strong>TGT 2</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="planned-route"><a class="header" href="#planned-route">Planned Route</a></h3>
<p>When leapfrogging, <strong>TGT 2</strong> always indicates the next turn point of the current
active flight plan. As the aircraft approaches this turn point (±2 nautical
miles), Jester will automatically update TGT 2 to the next turn point in the
sequence.</p>
<p>This enables the pilot to follow the entire route of the flight plan by
selecting NAV COMP on the Navigation Function Selector Panel and following the
corresponding indication on the HSI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_hsi.jpg" alt="HSI" /></p>
<h3 id="divert"><a class="header" href="#divert">Divert</a></h3>
<p>Besides following the flight plan, Jester is capable of diverting to a different
unplanned turn point using <strong>TGT 1</strong>.</p>
<p>Through the UI, players can switch between the diversion (TGT1) and flight plan
(TGT2) at any time.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_divert_option.jpg" alt="Divert Option" /></p>
<h3 id="pause--resume-route"><a class="header" href="#pause--resume-route">Pause &amp; Resume Route</a></h3>
<p>An active flight plan is indicated by the UI using an asterisk <code>*</code> next to the
current turn point.</p>
<p>Automatic turn point switching can be temporarily disabled per turn point using
the <strong>Holding</strong> option. Turn points designated for holding are marked with a
<code>h</code>.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_resume_flightplan.jpg" alt="Turn Point Modifiers" /></p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_nav_holding.jpg" alt="Turn Point Holding" /></p>
<p>When a flight plan has been paused, for example, because the pilot diverted to a
different point (using TGT 1), it can be reactivated through the UI again by
using the <strong>Go To/Resume</strong> option.</p>
<p>This also offers the possibility to skip turn points by jumping directly to any
turn point in its sequence, as well as returning to previous points or resuming
from a point designated for holding.</p>
<h2 id="tacan"><a class="header" href="#tacan">TACAN</a></h2>
<p>The TACAN equipment can be operated by both crew members independently and then
swapped between Pilot and WSO by using the <strong>Command Button</strong> on the panel.</p>
<p>Further, Jester is able to tune directly to any TACAN capable asset or ground
station.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_tacan_ground_station.jpg" alt="Tune TACAN Ground Station" /></p>
<p>This also allows the pilot to set up Jesters TACAN panel with a secondary setup
to then switch between both with a single click on the Command Button.</p>
<h2 id="uhf"><a class="header" href="#uhf">UHF</a></h2>
<p>The UHF radio is duplicated between both crew members and can be operated
independently. Using the <strong>Command Button</strong> allows the pilot to swap control
between their and Jesters setup. This enables the pilot to setup two
configurations and then swap between them fast with a single button press.</p>
<p>Jester is able to tune the radio directly to any nearby asset or ATC to enable
and open a communication channel conveniently and quick. Via ADF, this can also
be used for navigation.</p>

<p>During flight, Jester will constantly operate the radar and search for contacts.</p>
<p>In certain situations, such as during landing, on the ground or when performing
AAR, the radar will be in Standby mode. This can also be commanded manually by
selecting <code>Radar &gt; Operation &gt; Go Cold</code> in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_operation_options.jpg" alt="Select Operation Mode" /></p>
<p>When using the radar, Jester generally differentiates between two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan</li>
<li>Lock</li>
</ul>
<p>The phases are commanded and switched by the pilot using the Context Action.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jester will behave differently during a dogfight, indicated by the
pilot entering CAGE mode.</p>
<h2 id="scan"><a class="header" href="#scan">Scan</a></h2>
<p>This is the default phase Jester will be in. He will automatically point the
antenna at different altitudes and ranges in order to scan the entire space
ahead of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Jester will automatically identify any new contact and call them out to the
pilot.</p>
<p>If desired, the player can request Jester to perform an IFF challenge manually
at any time through the UI (this action can also be bound directly to a key).
Should the situation require, the player can manually set a zone for Jester to
scan outside of his regular pattern through the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/f4_jester_scan_zones.jpg" alt="Select Scan Zone" /></p>
<p>He will then scan this zone for a while first before proceeding back to his
regular pattern.</p>
<p>Likewise, the display range and scan type (wide or narrow) to be used during
scanning can be selected as well.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_select_display.jpg" alt="Select Display Settings" /></p>
<h3 id="target-selection"><a class="header" href="#target-selection">Target Selection</a></h3>
<p>Whenever a bandit becomes a threat (closer than 25 nm), Jester automatically
<strong>selects</strong> the target by moving and keeping the cursor on the corresponding
radar return.</p>
<p>The player can command target selection at any time by using the context
actions. This way, targets outside of the threat-range can be selected as well.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_scan_cursor_on_target.jpg" alt="Cursor On Target" /></p>
<p>Whenever a target within threat-range is selected, Jester will <strong>focus</strong> them,
stop the regular search pattern, automatically enter Narrow View and point the
antenna at the target in order to maximize tracking quality.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_focus.jpg" alt="Focussed On Target" /></p>
<p>This mode can be understood as <em>"Track While Scan"</em>, where Jester keeps the
radar on a specific contact, while still scanning the surrounding space,
identifying and calling out any new contact spotted.</p>
<p>Context actions only allow selection of hostile aircraft. Should the situation
require, other targets can always be focused directly through the UI instead.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_ui_focus.jpg" alt="Focussed On Target" /></p>
<p>Automatic target selection and focus behavior can be deactivated in the UI. This
can be useful if flying through a hostile zone, expecting contacts, while not
wanting to engage them and instead keep an overview and continuing the scan
pattern. For example when having an escort of fighters that will take care of
the bandits instead.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_operation_options.jpg" alt="Deactivate Auto-Focus" /></p>

</div>
<p>Unless only a single bandit shows on the screen, locking via ▄ (long) requires
prior target selection. Either automatically through Jester or by using •
(short). In an ambiguous situation, pressing ▄ (long) will first select the
target with highest priority.</p>
<p>Pressing •• (double) will reset the currently selected target and return Jester
to his standard behavior of automatically selecting the highest threat, if any.
Should one desire to ignore a target within threat range, automatic target focus
has to be deactivated through the UI first. •• (double) can then be pressed to
deselect the target.</p>
<h2 id="lock"><a class="header" href="#lock">Lock</a></h2>
<p>During a lock, Jester works the radar to keep the lock as long as possible.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_locked.jpg" alt="Locked Target" /></p>
<p>The UI also allows selecting a target to lock manually without using context
action.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jradar_ui_lock.jpg" alt="Lock Target Manually" /></p>
<p>If a contact should drop while Jester attempts to lock it, he will wait a few
seconds for the radar return to reappear.</p>

<p>💡 Should a lock be faulty and Jester does not notice it (for example odd
movement of the steering dot, or unexpected closure rate readouts), press ▄ to

</blockquote>
<h2 id="dogfight"><a class="header" href="#dogfight">Dogfight</a></h2>
<p>A within-visual-range situation is entered by the pilot activating CAGE or
BORESIGHT mode.</p>
<p>CAGE is entered by pressing the CAGE Button on the throttle, BORESIGHT can be
selected from the Jester Wheel.</p>
<p>In this mode, the radar is automatically boresighted forward and Jester will be
able to lock a return.</p>
<p>Further, the pilot can enter CAA mode where the system will automatically lock
any close contact.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Duration</th><th>Context Action</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</div>
<p>To lock a target in CAGE mode, press ▄ (long) once ready. Jester will now
automatically lock the first target return he can identify. If no target could
be found within a few seconds, Jester will abort the process and ▄ has to be
used again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Targets have to be within 5 degrees of the boresight or a lock attempt
would result in a bad lock. When Jester does not lock the return yet, it is
because he is waiting for the pilot to put it within that zone first.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="target-aspect"><a class="header" href="#target-aspect">Target Aspect</a></h3>
<p>To enable no-lock "flood" shots with the Sparrow, the pilot can tell Jester the
targets aspect.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jwheel_boresight_option.jpg" alt="Boresight Target Aspect" /></p>
<p>With the correct setting selected, a Sparrow can be launched and should be able
to track the target without first obtaining a radar lock.</p>
<p>The options can only be used if either in BORESIGHT or CAGE mode, using Context
Action • (short) will toggle between all aspect settings in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>NOSE (default)</li>
<li>FORWARD</li>
<li>AFT</li>
<li>TAIL</li>
<li>WIDE</li>
</ul>
<p>The default option is NOSE, to enable fast reaction to a threat coming straight
at the Phantom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to the difficulty of selecting the correct aspect, as well as the
target moving and hence changing its aspect after launch, such attacks
generally provide a rather low hit probability. However, it can be the only
option in certain situations, such as very low altitude fights.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pave-spike-1"><a class="header" href="#pave-spike-1">Pave Spike</a></h1>
<p>If equipped, Jester will ensure the targeting pod is ready for a 12-VIS dive
attack when required.</p>
<p>This can also be commanded manually by selecting either
<code>Air To Ground &gt; Pave Spike &gt; Operation &gt; Standby</code> or
<code>Air To Ground &gt; Pave Spike &gt; Operation &gt; Ready</code> in the UI.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jpod_operation_options.jpg" alt="Operation Options" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the UI allows the pilot to change the laser code used by Pave
Spike.</p>
<p>The pilot can command Jester to focus on operating the targeting pod by
selecting TGT FIND on the Delivery Mode Knob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to DSCG limitations, operation of the Pave Spike and the radar system
are mutually exclusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="12-vis-dive"><a class="header" href="#12-vis-dive">12-VIS Dive</a></h2>
<p>Pressing the <strong>Context Action</strong> will command Jester to lock the ground target
next to the reticle. A subsequent press will unlock the target again.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jpod_12_vis_dive_lock.jpg" alt="Pipper on Target" /></p>
<p>This can be used effectively in 12-VIS mode where the pilot points the nose on
the target in a short dive. After locking the target, the pilot can pull out of
the dive and either keep observing the target through the pod, or start an
attack. See
<a href="jester/combat/../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment/accurate_modes.html#target-find---tgt-find">4.3.3.4. Employment</a>
for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 Jester Pave Spike operation will be expanded throughout Early Access. To
overcome current limitations, the Pilot is provided with temporary binds to
control the WSOs Antenna Stick. This allows the pilot to use the targeting pod
more effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bombing"><a class="header" href="#bombing">Bombing</a></h1>
<p>Dropping ordnance on ground targets with Jester consists of two phases.
Initially, Jester has to prepare for the attack by entering corresponding data
into the panels. For most modes, the attack run itself can be executed by the
pilot alone. However, for Dive Toss and Dive Laydown modes, Jester must lock the
ground return using the radar.</p>
<h2 id="preparation"><a class="header" href="#preparation">Preparation</a></h2>
<p>To prepare a bombing run, both pilot and WSO have to enter several settings
throughout the cockpit.</p>
<p>For Jester, this includes the WRCS panel, such as the <strong>Release Range</strong>,
<strong>Target Altitude</strong> or <strong>Release Advance</strong>, as well as the LABS angles and
timers.</p>
<p>To prepare Jester for a bombing run, use the
<a href="jester/combat/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Computer</a> tool and transfer the solution
by utilizing the <strong>Tell Jester</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jester_bombing_table.jpg" alt="Tell Jester UI" /></p>
<p>Once activated, Jester will do his part in preparing the aircraft for the
desired attack.</p>
<h2 id="dive-toss"><a class="header" href="#dive-toss">Dive Toss</a></h2>
<p>During a Dive Toss or Dive Laydown attack, indicated by DT or DL selected on the
Delivery Mode Knob, the <strong>Context Action</strong> can be used to command Jester to lock
the ground return after placing the nose on the target. A subsequent press will
unlock the target again.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jester_dive_toss_prepare.jpg" alt="Pipper on Target" /></p>
<p>This way, ground targets can be attacked effectively during a dive. The pilot
places the reticle on the target, commands Jester to lock the return and then
pulls up while holding down the Bomb Button. Weapons will be released
automatically shortly after.</p>
<p><img src="jester/combat/../../img/jester_dive_toss_locked.jpg" alt="Ground Return Locked" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-3"><a class="header" href="#other-3">Other</a></h1>
<p>During the entire flight, Jester will assist the pilot in all situations.</p>
<p>He will call out bandits during a dogfight and give the pilot steering tips.
Jester might tell the pilot in which direction to evade when attacked by a
missile, make him aware of any friendly traffic spotted or also simply when the
AVTR cassette is full.</p>
<p>While lacking a fuel gauge in his cockpit, he will observe the clock and the
pilots flying style to remind him about checking the fuel level or consumption
when forgetting to leave the Fuel Dump switch activated.</p>
<p><img src="jester/../img/jester_fuel_check.jpg" alt="Jester Fuel Check" /></p>
<p>Jester is able to assess and report battle damage to a certain degree and much
more.</p>
<h2 id="startup"><a class="header" href="#startup">Startup</a></h2>
<p>Whenever the pilot performs a cold start of the aircraft, Jester will
automatically get his cockpit ready for flight as well.</p>
<p>Most notably, this includes the INS alignment. During startup, Jester will ask
the pilot if he is ready for alignment and which alignment option to choose.</p>
<p>Alignment should only be started once the pilot is sure that power will remain
stable and the aircraft will not have to be moved until the procedure is
finished.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Jester is able to abort an alignment if the pilot really has to start
moving already. Expect degraded INS performance in this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="takeoff-and-landing-assistance"><a class="header" href="#takeoff-and-landing-assistance">Takeoff and Landing Assistance</a></h2>
<p>When taking off, Jester will report key values for the airspeed, indicating to
the pilot when to initiate the roll.</p>
<p>By default, Jester will assist the player during landing by giving altitude
callouts, similar as seen in civilian aviation. This way, the pilot can better
estimate the current position, especially given the reduced forward visibility
in the Phantom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 This option can be disabled, see
<a href="jester/../dcs/special_options.html#jester-landing-callouts">9.2. Special Options</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="aerial-refueling"><a class="header" href="#aerial-refueling">Aerial Refueling</a></h2>
<p>Jester provides steering assistance to the pilot during AAR.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, he will guide the pilot towards the right spot for the
tanker to connect the boom, for example by saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Move 5 feet forward.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="jester/../img/aar_connected.jpg" alt="AAR Connected" /></p>
<p>Once connected, he will look up and focus on the booms colored marks. Jester
calls out whenever the pilot is drifting too much in either direction, indicated
by the boom showing the yellow or red marks.</p>
<p>The perfect mark in the middle is called the <em>donut</em>.</p>

who is responsible for the assigned aircraft when it's on the ground.
This important role involves not only keeping the aircraft in good shape
by conducting maintenance, but also preparing it for flight.
The preparation for take off begins long before the aircraft crew arrives,
but the chief also directly assists the crew during startup and shutdown.</p>

<p>The F-4 <a href="crew_chief/../procedures/overview.html">procedures</a> include several ground checks, which objective is to
make sure that certain systems are working and set correctly.
Our F-4 crew chief can assist the pilot during following checks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitot Heat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spoiler Actuator</strong></li>
<li>Air Refuelling Door</li>
<li>Speed Brakes</li>
<li>Slats and Flaps</li>

<li><strong>Trim Neutral</strong></li>
<li>Tail Hook</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them are triggered automatically
(e.g. when the chief notices speed brakes extending/retracting, he will announce it).
More advanced checks (<strong>bold ones</strong>) have to be initiated manually.</p>
<p>Some of them can also be conducted without crew chief, by acquiring visual confirmation from the WSO,
but not all of them because of the limited visibility from the cockpit.</p>
<h3 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h3>
<p>More advanced checks are explained here in detail:</p>

<h2 id="communication"><a class="header" href="#communication">Communication</a></h2>
<p>Both crew-members can communicate with the chief using one of two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intercom - crew chief's headset is connected to the aircraft <a href="crew_chief/../systems/nav_com/intercom.html">intercom system</a>
using a cord providing 2-way communication similar to the communication between Pilot and WSO</li>
<li>Hand signals - the aircraft crew communicates with the chief in 1-way fashion using hand signals;
when this method is used, the crew chief features are limited;
you will be able to ask for the simpler actions like the wheel chocks removal
but the crew chief won't help you in conducting visual checks</li>
</ul>
<p>In both modes you can communicate with the crew chief using Jester wheel <strong>"Crew Chief"</strong> menu.
The aircraft has to be stationary.</p>
<p>If the intercom system is set up correctly and powered up and the wheel chocks are placed,
the intercom mode will be active,
otherwise hand signals mode will be used and
the "(hand signals)" text will be added to the "Crew Chief" menu name to indicate that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Since the external intercom is wired in parallel with the WSO's microphone and headset,
the ground crew and WSO can block each other during simultaneous transmissions.
In addition, the WSO's function selector switch must be in <strong>HOT MIC</strong> to allow
aircraft to ground communications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can verify the 2-way communication by using "Comms Check" option.</p>

<p><img src="procedures/takeoff/../../img/takeoff_real.jpg" alt="Takeoff Photo" />
<em>A right front view of an F-4 Phantom II aircraft taking off
from Shiraz Air Base during exercise Cento</em></p>
<h2 id="normal-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#normal-takeoff">Normal Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>The slats out-flaps down position is recommended for all
takeoffs. After line-up on the runway and completing
necessary pre-takeoff checks, engines can be run to 85%
with brakes held and nose gear steering engaged to ensure
nose gear alignment. With both engines
operating in excess of 85% and the brakes locked, there is
a possibility of rotating the tires on the wheel rims or
skidding the tires. Check for normal rpm response and
approximate readings of 450°C EGT, 4000 pph fuel flow, ¼
nozzles, and 30-40 psi oil pressure. After releasing brakes,
advance both throttles rapidly to full military power and
check rpm, exhaust temperatures and nozzle position.
WSO check the ramps fully retracted. If an afterburner
takeoff is desired, shift the throttles into the afterburner
detent and advance full forward for max thrust. Maintain
directional control with nose gear steering or rudder as
required. The rudder becomes effective for steering at
approximately 70 knots. Wheel braking should not be used
for directional control during takeoff roll. Nose gear
steering should be disengaged when rudder steering
becomes effective. If it becomes necessary to re-engage
nose gear steering at the higher speeds, rudder pedals
should be returned to neutral prior to engagement since
rudder displacement necessary for rudder steering will
generally be excessive for nose gear steering. Sufficient aft
stick should be applied prior to nose wheel liftoff speed to
attain the desired pitch attitude. As the nose rises, pitch
attitude must be controlled to maintain a 10° to 12° (first
pitch mark) nose high attitude for aircraft fly-off. Caution
must be exercised to preclude over-rotation due to
excessive aft stick rate or an extended takeoff roll due to
late lift-off. The basic takeoff attitude should be held
during acceleration and transition to a clean
configuration. Trim change and control action during this
period are normal. The AUX AIR DOORS, WHEELS, and
MASTER CAUTION lights may illuminate momentarily
as the landing gear and flaps are retracted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Rapid full aft movement of the stick between
takeoff airspeed and 30 knots below takeoff
airspeed may result in the stabilator hitting the
runway with the possibility of stabilator actuator
damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="procedures/takeoff/../../img/takeoff.jpg" alt="Takeoff" /></p>
<h2 id="no-flap-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-takeoff">No-Flap Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>No-flap takeoffs are not recommended. However, if it is
determined that no-flap takeoffs must be performed to
satisfy mission requirements, aircrews should be aware
that takeoff roll and airspeed will be increased and: the
takeoff attitude will be slightly steeper. Stabilator
effectiveness is considerably increased and extreme
caution must be exercised to prevent over-rotation which
could result in the stabilator striking the runway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Due to increased stabilator authority with the
flaps up, aircraft rotation can be initiated at
lower than normal airspeeds and over-rotation is
a definite possibility. If it appears that
over-rotation is occurring, positive control
movement (stick forward) must be taken to
prevent the stabilator from contacting the
runway and/or loss of aircraft control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff">Minimum Run / Heavy Gross Weight Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>A minimum run/heavy gross weight takeoff (aircraft over
55,500 pounds) is accomplished in the same manner as a
normal takeoff with the following exceptions: It is
recommended that all minimum run/heavy gross weight
takeoffs be made with afterburner. During the takeoff-run,
full aft stick must be applied prior to reaching 80 knots. As
the aircraft starts to rotate, the stick should be adjusted to
maintain 10° to 12° pitch attitude for aircraft fly-off. The
possibility of a main landing gear tire failure increases
with an extended takeoff ground run under heavy gross
weight conditions. Nose wheel liftoff speed and takeoff
speed is increased during heavy gross weight conditions.
In the event of an aborted takeoff, it must be remembered
that stopping distance is greatly increased as abort speed
increases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: With a combination of light gross weight and aft
CG, the minimum run takeoff technique (i.e., full
aft stick prior to reaching 80 knots) produces
rapid pitch rates during nose rotation. This
combination can exist when the radar package
and nose gun (or equivalent ballast) are not
installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="crosswind-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-takeoff">Crosswind Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>Under crosswind conditions, the aircraft tends to weather
vane into the wind. The weathervaning tendency can be
easily controlled with nose gear steering. As forward speed
increases, weathervaning tendency decreases. At speeds
above 70 knots rudder effectiveness will normally be
sufficient to maintain directional control. After the nose is
lifted to takeoff attitude, the aircraft will have a tendency
to drift toward the downwind side of the runway.
Therefore, when a long time period is expected between
nose lift-off and aircraft fly-off, or when the crosswind
effect is particularly severe, nose lift-off can be delayed
accordingly. Under normal operational conditions this
action should not be required. As the aircraft leaves the
ground, it should be crabbed into the wind, wings level, to
maintain runway alignment. Takeoff in gusty crosswind
or severe wake turbulence conditions can result in an
abrupt wing low attitude at or near lift-off. When these
conditions are anticipated, use higher than computed
takeoff speed to provide additional lateral control after
lift-off.</p>
<h2 id="after-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#after-takeoff">After Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>When the aircraft is definitely airborne:</p>
<p>Retract the gear. Check that the landing gear position indicators
display the word UP, and that the landing gear
handle warning light is out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: The landing gear and gear doors should be
completely up and locked before the gear limit
airspeed of 250 knots is reached, otherwise,
excessive air loads may damage the landing gear
mechanism and prevent subsequent operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set slats and flaps to NORM.
Check that slat flap indicators display IN and UP.
Rudder jumps may occur during flap retraction
with a lateral stick input. If an audible
(noticeable in head phones) chattering associated
with slat flap and utility hydraulic pressure
indicator fluctuating in unison occurs during
slats flaps retraction, maintain airspeed below
250 knots and cycle slats flaps. If slat chatter
occurs during maneuvering at altitude, it may
require opposite slats positioning from where
chatter occurs. If chatter persists, extend slats
flaps and land as soon as practical. If cycling (slats
repositioning) eliminates chatter, continue
mission and make an appropriate entry in AF
Form 781.</p>
<h2 id="climb"><a class="header" href="#climb">Climb</a></h2>
<p>A simplified climb can be made by maintaining a 10° to 12°
(first pitch mark) nose high attitude until reaching 350
knots and then vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350
knots until reaching cruise Mach/TAS. Vary pitch as
necessary to maintain cruise Mach/TAS until reaching
cruise altitude. A simplified Maximum thrust climb, at
normal gross weights, can be made by maintaining a 10°
to 12° nose high attitude until reaching 350 knots and then
vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350 knots until
reaching Mach 0.9. Vary the pitch attitude as necessary to
maintain Mach 0.9 until reaching cruise altitude.</p>

<h2 id="descent--before-landing"><a class="header" href="#descent--before-landing">Descent / Before Landing</a></h2>
<p>The Descent/Before Landing check should be
accomplished above 10,000 feet AGL and at a time when
mission/flight demands are not critical. Prior to
performing a rapid descent, the windshield and canopy
surfaces should be preheated to prevent the formation of
frost or fog. If it becomes necessary to dump fuel during a
descent, thrust settings in excess of 85% rpm may be
required to ensure rapid inflight dumping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to limited forward visibility, it is advisable to raise
the seat up before entering the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="landing-technique"><a class="header" href="#landing-technique">Landing Technique</a></h2>
<p>For a normal landing, fly the pattern as illustrated in
figure. Enter the pattern as local policy dictates.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_pattern.jpg" alt="Landing Pattern" /></p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_pattern_2.jpg" alt="Landing Pattern 2" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: If high angles of attack develop during the turn
to downwind, the rudder should be used as a
primary means of rollout since adverse yaw may
be introduced by the use of ailerons. Altitude may
be insufficient for recovery if uncontrolled flight
is encountered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid buffet throughout the landing pattern. Adjust
power, as necessary, to attain allowable gear lowering
airspeed. Extend landing gear and slats and flaps in level
flight on downwind. Actual flap extension may not occur
until slowing to 210 knots. Ensure slats out-flaps down
prior to initiating turn to base leg. The optimum indicated
AOA for approach is 19.2 units, and is adequate for all
gross weight and normal slat flap configurations. The
AOA aural tone system provides an audible cue to
maintain an on-speed approach (steady tone played at medium pitch).
During very gusty flight
conditions, full aileron may not be sufficient to correct a
wing low condition. When landing in gusty or crosswind
conditions, with wake turbulence, with high internal fuel
load (aft CG), or with an abnormal configuration (slats in,
asymmetric slats or slats partially extended), a 17 unit
AOA approach is recommended. A transition to ON
SPEED and a flared landing will reduce the touchdown
speed. The AOA indexer and aural tone indications
remain unaffected. Establish and maintain On Speed
angle-of-attack on the base leg or final approach,
adjusting pitch attitude to maintain AOA and power to
maintain desired glide slope/rate of descent. Cross-check
computed airspeed and On Speed AOA to detect gross
errors in AOA. When the aircraft reaches 20 to 30 feet
altitude above the ground, ground effect will tend to rotate
the aircraft in the nose-down direction. Maintaining pitch
attitude will result in transition to a slightly slow
indication at touch-down which is desired. Flying a 2 1/2°
to 3° glide slope will produce an approach rate of descent
of about 700 feet per minute. Sink rate at touchdown will
be appreciably reduced by ground effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Flying a steeper than normal final approach or
not maintaining pitch attitude when entering
ground effect, can cause touchdown sink rates to
exceed the design limit of the main landing gear
struts.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- (Refer to section V for touchdown sink
rates vs gross weight limitations.) -->
<p>At touchdown, reduce power to idle and deploy drag chute.
Use full aft stick to help decelerate. Use rudder and
ailerons for directional control down to 70 knots then use
differential braking. Nose gear steering should not be
required for directional control in light crosswind
conditions. However, if rudder, aileron, and/or
differential braking are not effective in maintaining
directional control, use nose gear steering as required.
Engage nose gear steering only with the rudder at or near
neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Nose gear steering malfunctions can cause loss of
directional control if engaged at high ground
speed; therefore, it should not be engaged above
taxi speed unless required to maintain directional
control during crosswind landing conditions. If no
response is noted or unscheduled steering
responses are detected when engaging nose gear
steering, disengage immediately and do not
reengage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During braking, cycling of the anti-skid system can be
detected by a change in longitudinal deceleration. Cycling
may not be apparent when braking at high speed
immediately after landing, with drag chute failure, or
with a wet or icy runway. Do not misinterpret this as
anti-skid failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Drag chute should not be dropped on the runway or a taxiway.
A popular technique is to leave it on the side of a taxiway
by appropriately orienting the aircraft, inflating the chute
with the engines and then releasing it in the desired direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="no-flap-landing"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-landing">No-Flap Landing</a></h2>
<p>Refer to <a href="procedures/landing/../../emergency_procedures/overwiew.html">EMERGENCY PROCEDURES</a></p>
<!-- TODO: add specific procedure link -->
<h2 id="short-field-landing"><a class="header" href="#short-field-landing">Short Field Landing</a></h2>
<p>Short field landings require that normal final approach
procedures be followed with precision and the aircraft be
touched down as close to the end of the runway as safety
permits. Full aft stick throughout the landing roll
increases both aerodynamic drag and wheel brake
effectiveness. Apply maximum braking by fully
depressing the brake pedals to the pedal stops as soon as
the nose gear is on the ground and nose gear steering is
engaged. Nose gear steering should be used to maintain
runway alignment and supplemented with differential
braking only if required.</p>
<p>Operation on the AM-2 aluminum mat is similar to that
conducted on a concrete runway of equivalent size.
Arrestment should be regarded as an emergency
procedure. However, since the aircraft is fully suitable for
arrested landings, extremely adverse meteorological or
operational conditions may warrant consideration of
landing into a suitable approach-end arresting gear.</p>
<h2 id="crosswind-landing-dry-runway"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-landing-dry-runway">Crosswind Landing (Dry Runway)</a></h2>
<p>Carefully compensate for crosswind in the traffic pattern
to guard against undershooting or overshooting the final
turn. Fly the final approach course with the aircraft
ground track properly aligned with the runway. The
crosswind may be compensated for either by using the
wing low method, the crab method, or a combination of the
two. When using the wing low method, the ARI can be
overpowered by use of the rudder pedals or the ARI can be
disengaged by pulling the rudder trim circuit breaker. If
the crab method is employed, the aircraft heading should
be aligned with the runway just prior to touchdown. After
touchdown, use rudder, aileron and spoiler, and nose gear
steering as required to maintain directional control.
Crosswind effect on the aircraft is not severe; however,
rudder, differential braking, and/or nose gear steering
must be used as required to maintain alignment with the
runway. Use of the drag chute intensifies the weather
vane effect for any given deployment condition. The
weather vane effect increases as the forward velocity of
the aircraft decreases, therefore, if the drag chute is to be
used, it should be used at the initial portion rather than
the latter portion of the landing roll. This also assures use
of the drag chute in the speed region where it is most
effective. If the drag chute is used and excessive
weathervaning is encountered, jettison drag chute. Since
the nose gear will rapidly assume a position relative to the
rudder pedals, nose gear steering should be initiated with
the rudder pedals at or near the neutral position. For this
reason the use of nose gear steering is advocated early in
the landing roll rather than at a time when large amounts
of rudder are required to hold the aircraft aligned on the
runway. Keep in mind that only really tiny amounts of nose gear steering should be used as there is
a high risk of a nose gear steering hardover. The most important aspect of directional control
under crosswind conditions is keeping the aircraft
precisely aligned with the runway rather than trying to
correct back to the runway centerline after it has deviated.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_crosswind.jpg" alt="Crosswind Landing Guide" /></p>
<h2 id="wet-or-icy-runway-landing"><a class="header" href="#wet-or-icy-runway-landing">Wet or Icy Runway Landing</a></h2>
<p>Wet or icy runway conditions pose severe problems in
directional control and braking effectiveness. On wet
runways, these problems are primarily the result of
hydroplaning where the tire rides on a thin layer of water
and produces little or no traction. The probability of
hydroplaning increases with increased water depth,
increased ground speed, decreased tire pressure and
decreased tire tread depth and is also affected by runway
surface texture and tire tread design. Hydroplaning can
occur on runways which appear only damp if severe
braking is applied at high speeds. Hydroplaning and glare
ice present essentially the same problems. Due to the
reduced directional control, all landings on a wet or icy
runway should be made utilizing a crosswind technique.
Refer to the Crosswind Landing Guide (figure 2-7) to
determine the advisability of making an approach-end
engagement. The pilot should also consider the
desirability of delaying the landing to permit the runway
to dry or diverting to another field. Gross weight should be
reduced to the minimum practicable. Plan the pattern to
be well established on final with the aircraft tracking
straight down the runway centerline with an ON SPEED
indication. Use a wings - level crab, if required, to
maintain the track. Establish the rate of descent at 800
fpm (slightly steeper than normal) and plan to touchdown
on the centerline within the first 500 feet. Make a firm
touchdown (500-600 fpm) while maintaining the
wings-level crab. Immediately after touchdown retard the
throttles to idle. Do not attempt to align the aircraft
heading with the runway as this will result in a drift off
the runway if the aircraft is sliding or hydroplaning.
Maintain full forward stick to increase nosewheel
traction. As wheel cornering capability overcomes
aerodynamic effects the aircraft will align itself with the
runway. Do not attempt to hasten this process. When the
aircraft heading is aligned with the runway centerline,
deploy the drag chute. Be prepared to jettison the drag
chute if the weathervaning effect interferes with
maintaining the track straight down the runway
centerline. Nose gear steering is the primary method of
directional control and should be utilized as early as
possible. Nose gear steering should be engaged only with
the rudder pedals at or near neutral. When directional
control is firmly established utilize maximum anti-skid
braking. Brake pedals must be fully depressed to achieve
maximum deceleration. At high speeds the braking
potential will be very low and little deceleration will be
felt. As braking potential increases with decreasing speed,
the anti-skid system will increase deceleration
accordingly. Unless the pilot is familiar with the variables
in braking potential, the low deceleration at high speed
may be mistakenly interpreted as a brake or anti-skid
failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 CAUTION: Rubber deposits on the last 2000 feet of wet
runway make directional control a difficult
problem even at very low speeds. Braking should
be started in sufficient time so as not to require
excessive braking on the last portion of the
runway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heavy-gross-weight-landing"><a class="header" href="#heavy-gross-weight-landing">Heavy Gross Weight Landing</a></h2>
<p>The heavy gross weight landing pattern is the same as the
basic pattern shown in figure 2-6 with the exception that
it should be expanded slightly to compensate for the lower
maneuvering capability of the heavy gross weight aircraft
at low speeds. As in the normal pattern, an on-speed
indication on the indexer will provide the optimum angle
of attack and airspeed for the aircraft in the landing
configuration for both level flight and maneuvering flight.
Refer to Performance Data, appendix A, for airspeed
versus gross weight at approach AOA.</p>
<h2 id="go-around"><a class="header" href="#go-around">Go-Around</a></h2>
<p>Any decision to go around should be made as early as
possible. When the decision to go around is made,
smoothly increase thrust to military (afterburner if
required). Do not attempt to rotate the nose or stop
rate-of-descent until adequate airspeed is built up.
Continue to use the on speed indication as the optimum
angle of attack until level flight is attained. As airspeed
increases, establish normal takeoff attitude, retract gear
when a positive rate of climb is established, retract slats
and flaps at a safe airspeed (180 knots minimum) and go
around. Rudder jumps may occur during flap retraction
with lateral stick input. For a closed pattern, accomplish
a climbing 180° turn to roll out on downwind at 220 to 250
knots. Refer to Go-Around, figure 2-8. During go-around
a rapid trim change is required to preclude high forward
stick forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Do not exceed 18 units AOA during go-around
with gear retracted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="touch-and-go"><a class="header" href="#touch-and-go">Touch-And-Go</a></h2>
<p>After making a normal approach and touchdown,
smoothly advance throttles to full military power. Apply
aft stick until the nose rotates 10° to 12° of pitch attitude
maintaining this attitude until the aircraft is flying. When
definitely airborne retract the gear, followed by the flaps
as the aircraft accelerates through 180 knots minimum.</p>

<p>This subchapter contains special procedures for operating the F-4E Phantom II.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/special_procedures/../../img/scramble.jpg" alt="Scramble" />
<em>Pilots scramble to their F-4 Phantom II aircraft on alert during exercise William Tell '80</em></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cartridge-start"><a class="header" href="#cartridge-start">Cartridge Start</a></h1>
<p>This procedure is based upon external power not being
available. During routine (other than scramble/exercise)
cartridge starts, it is advisable to use external electrical
power, if available, as this will allow use of the CNI, fire
and overheat warning circuits, and all engine instruments
during the start. If external power is used, normal
generator switching should be used. To avoid possible
irritation caused by cartridge exhaust smoke/gases, it
may be advisable to close canopies and select 100% oxygen
during start cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Never attempt to load or unload a cartridge in
either starter with the engine master switches on,
ground refueling switch on, or external electrical
power applied. If a malfunction in safety circuits
occurs, serious injury could result.</p>

<tr><td>8</td><td>Alarm Check</td><td>The KY-28 will perform an automatic alarm check when the mode switch is set to C and the power knob is set to On. The check will continue for about 2 seconds after power is applied. During this time a steady, unbroken 1200 Hz tone is heard in the headsets. Upon successful completion of the check, the 1200 Hz tone is interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clear Interrupted Tone</td><td>Momentarily position the microphone button to UHF to clear the interrupted tone. When the microphone button is released, the KY-28 reverts to the standby condition and is ready for either transmission or reception.

<tr><td>10</td><td>Alarm Check Failure</td><td>Note: If the KY-28 fails the alarm check, the power knob must be set to OFF and the mode switch to P (plain) to enable conventional UHF communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Transmit Ciphered Messages</td><td>To transmit ciphered messages, position the microphone button to UHF and wait until a momentary tone is heard before voice input. With the power knob set to ON, the momentary tone is delayed 0.5 seconds after pressing the microphone button. During this time, an encryption check is performed and the sync preamble is transmitted to receiving stations. If the encryption check fails, a 1200 Hz tone interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate is presented in the headsets and cipher transmission is not possible. If the encryption check succeeds, a momentary tone is heard in the headsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cipher Radio Communications</td><td>After the momentary tone is heard, establish two-way cipher radio communications with a cooperating station and check for readability and signal strength and/or transmit your message. Upon releasing the microphone button, the KY-28 will return to the standby condition. Simultaneous transmission by two or more stations on the same frequency is not possible and may result in garbled messages or loss of synchronization.</td></tr>

<p>Optimum use of the aircraft to obtain maximum performance with minimum fuel
consumption requires careful preflight planning for the mission. The planning of
a mission involves many things which are beyond the scope of this publication.
As used here, mission planning will cover certain key phases of a mission and
explain the use of performance charts.</p>
<p>The following sample Counter Air mission demonstrates features of performance
data. Although the sample problem does not cover the many mission capabilities
of the aircraft, it familiarizes the aircrew with the use of performance data so
that any mission may be preflight planned in a short time.</p>
<p>The sample problem illustrates, through a graphical solution, how performance
charts can be integrated to form a complete mission flight plan. The steps used
to develop such a plot are shown with the problem.</p>
<h2 id="counter-air-mission-profile"><a class="header" href="#counter-air-mission-profile">Counter Air Mission Profile</a></h2>
<p>Perform maximum thrust takeoff and climb at military thrust. Cruise at optimum
altitude and maximum range speed to a combat zone 500 miles from the air base.
Drop external tanks when empty. Perform combat maneuvering at maximum thrust for
the full duration — allowed by return and landing fuel requirements. Missiles
and gun rounds are assumed to be expended at the end of the combat period.
Return to the airfield at optimum altitude and airspeed. Descend at maximum
range descent, arriving at the destination with 2000 pounds landing fuel
reserve. The Counter Air Mission Overview and the Sample Mission Plan depict the
overall mission plan.</p>

<!-- would be cool to have some emergency "frame" (2-colored stripe around page) like in manual -->
<p>This section contains procedures to be followed to correct
an emergency condition. These procedures will insure
maximum safety for the crew and/or aircraft until a safe
landing or other appropriate action is accomplished. The
procedures are arranged in the most desirable sequence
for the majority of cases; therefore, the steps should be
performed in the listed sequence unless the pilot can
determine a good cause for deviation. Multiple
emergencies, adverse weather, and other peculiar
conditions may require modification of these procedures.
The critical items <strong>(BOLD FACE LETTERS)</strong> contained in the
various emergency procedures cover the most adverse
conditions. <strong>Aircrew members should be able to accomplish
bold face procedures without reference to the checklist.</strong>
The nature and severity of the encountered emergency
will dictate the necessity for complying with the critical
items in their entirety. It is essential, therefore, that
aircrews determine the correct course of action by use of
common sense and sound judgement. As soon as possible,
the pilot should notify the WSO, flight or flight leader, and
tower of any existing emergency and of the intended
action.</p>
<p>The terms "Land as soon as <strong>possible</strong>" and "Land as soon
as <strong>practical</strong>" are used in this section. These terms are
defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as possible</strong> - An emergency will be declared.
A landing should be accomplished at the nearest suitable
airfield considering the severity of the emergency,
weather conditions, field facilities, ambient lighting,
aircraft gross weight, and command guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as practical</strong> - Emergency conditions are less
urgent, and although the mission is to be terminated, the
degree of the emergency is such that an immediate
landing at the nearest adequate airfield may not be
necessary.</p>
<p>The following basic rules apply to all aircraft emergencies
and should be thoroughly understood by all aircrew:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain aircraft control.</li>
<li>Analyze the situation and take proper action.</li>
<li>Land as soon as practical.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="emergency_procedures/../intro/definitions.html">Definitions</a> for an explanation of the symbology used.</p>

<h2 id="glide-distance"><a class="header" href="#glide-distance">GLIDE DISTANCE</a></h2>
<p>With both engines failed, the aircraft will glide
approximately 6 nautical miles for each 5000 feet AGL.
The recommended glide airspeed for maximum range with
both engines out is 215 knots. This speed will allow the
windmilling engines to maintain power control hydraulic

airstart.</p>
<h2 id="ejection"><a class="header" href="#ejection">EJECTION</a></h2>
<p>At ground level with wings level, canopy closed, and no

pounds. Boarding weight includes the crewmember and all
personal equipment with which he boards the aircraft. If
either crewmember’s boarding weight is over 247 pounds,
the minimum ejection airspeed is 50 knots. Initiate
ejection below 450 knots if possible. Although the seat is
qualified to 600 knots, ejection above 450 knots exposes the
crewmember to forces which can cause serious injury. If
airspeed is over 550 knots, minimum ejection altitude is 50

<h2 id="emergency-landing-pattern"><a class="header" href="#emergency-landing-pattern">EMERGENCY LANDING PATTERN</a></h2>
<p>The emergency landing pattern is a pattern to be flown
when engine thrust is available and an emergency exists
or there is a malfunction which could result in an
emergency. The primary objective of the pattern is to land
the aircraft safely in the first attempt with least amount
of risk. Because of the many variables involved, such as
type of emergency, position and altitude in relation to the
field, gross weight, fuel remaining, weather, populated
areas, runway length, availability of arresting gear, etc.,
astandard pattern cannot be prescribed. Depending on the
circumstances it might be desirable to utilize GCA, make
a straight-in approach, enter the pattern from downwind
or base leg, or make a 360° overhead pattern. Because of
the various circumstances, the pilot’s evaluation of all
factors and his judgment will determine the type of
landing pattern to be flown. However, there are some
general guidelines which are applicable regardless of
approach selected: Reduce gross weight to minimum
practical. In the pattern and before establishing the
landing configuration, maintain a minimum maneuvering
airspeed of 230 knots (250 knots, single engine). The
pattern should be planned to avoid abrupt, steep or hard
turns and large or abrupt power changes especially with
a flight control malfunction or a hydraulic system failure.
Circumstances permitting, a long straight-in final should
be planned and the landing configuration established
when on final. The air refuel switch should be placed to
EXTEND prior to landing to depressurize the fuel tanks.
Should the nature of the emergency or other factors
dictate establishing the landing configuration prior to
final, 230 knots — flaps up, or 200 knots - slats flaps OUT
AND DOWN should be maintained until established on
final. These airspeeds will provide a margin of safety for
maneuvering flight. If the pattern must be entered on
downwind, base or from an overhead pattern, the pattern
should be expanded, the landing configuration established
prior to final, and roll-out on final should be at least 2-
3 miles out. A normal 2-3° glide slope should be flown. For
most emergencies, final approach airspeeds are increased
and AOA decreased to provide adequate aircraft handling
characteristics.</p>

<p>Of special note is a <a href="dcs/modding/overview.html">modding guide</a> and explanation available
to <a href="dcs/mission_editor.html">mission designers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/phantom_livery.jpg" alt="Creative Painting on a Phantom" />

<p><img src="dcs/../img/controls_overview.jpg" alt="Controls Overview" /></p>
<p>Available control binds for the Phantom are exhaustive. For any switch, knob or
button, you can choose between direct position-binds, increment or decrement
binds, a toggle or next option, special binds for 2-way or 3-way switches and
assignable axis.</p>
<p>In total, both cockpits feature around 1000 assignable binds and 200 axis each.</p>
<p>As example, the <strong>Speed Brake</strong> switch provides 8 binds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed Brake - In</li>
<li>Speed Brake - Stop</li>
<li>Speed Brake - Out (Hold)</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Aft]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Forward]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - [Next]</li>
<li>Speed Brake - In/Stop (3-way up)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Out</strong>-position is marked <strong>(Hold)</strong> to signal that the position is
spring-loaded and will return to center once released.</p>
<p>Binds <strong>[Aft]</strong> and <strong>[Forward]</strong> are directional binds that move the switch
from the current position into the given direction.</p>
<p><strong>[Next]</strong> is similar, but will not stop at the last position and wrap over to
the first position again. Likewise, 2-way switches provide a <strong>[Toggle]</strong> bind
that flips the switch between either position.</p>
<p>The <strong>(3-way up)</strong>-bind is intended to be used with actual 3-way hardware
switches, such as present on many external devices. They send a signal on either
position (up and down), but no signal on the center position. Hence, the bind
will return the switch back to the center when no signal is send.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The <strong>(3-way down)</strong>-bind is skipped for the Speed Brake, since it would be
identical with the spring-loaded <strong>Out (Hold)</strong>-bind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All binds are generally assigned at least two searchable categories, the
<strong>system</strong> the bind belongs to and its <strong>location</strong> in the cockpit. The <strong>Master
Arm</strong> switch for example has categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapons</li>
<li>Main Panel</li>
<li>Weapon Selection Panel</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sim-pit"><a class="header" href="#sim-pit">Sim-Pit</a></h2>
<p>Additionally to regular binds, special <strong>[SimPit]</strong>-binds are provided that
allow controlling any switch or knob via an axis input.</p>
<p>For example, a switch with 2 positions ON and OFF can be controlled with an
axis, while the switch changes its position as soon as the axis is pushed beyond
its center position.</p>
<p>This is especially useful for builders of cockpit replicas, working mainly with
hardware switches whose electronic components send normalized inputs through the
entire movement range.</p>
<h2 id="jester--crew-chief-commands"><a class="header" href="#jester--crew-chief-commands">Jester &amp; Crew Chief Commands</a></h2>
<p>Direct binds to control Jester and Crew Chief commands are provided especially
for mission designers or users of voice recognition software, such as
<strong>VoiceAttack</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/jester_commands_binds.jpg" alt="Jester Commands" /></p>
<p>This allows use of the corresponding actions directly via a bind instead of
using the UI to select them.</p>
<h2 id="binding-guide"><a class="header" href="#binding-guide">Binding Guide</a></h2>
<p>When just getting started, a common question is which fundamental controls one should
generally bind and have accessible without using the mouse, besides the obvious
binds of throttle and stick axis.</p>
<p>Within DCS these binds are categorized as <strong>Essentials</strong> to make finding them easier.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/bind_category_essentials.jpg" alt="Essential Category" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Items marked <strong>bold</strong> are highly recommended to be bound. <em>Italic</em> sections
are suggestions of which positions to bind.</p>

<p>The columns have the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close Menu - when releasing the key, the DCS communication menu is
automatically closed</li>
<li>Menu must be open - the key only works when the DCS communication menu is
currently open</li>
<li>Export Voice - when pressed down, voice is exported to tools like SRS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stick-deflection-limit"><a class="header" href="#stick-deflection-limit">Stick Deflection Limit</a></h2>
<p>Limits the maximum force in lbf (Pound-Force), i.e. strength, the pilot is able
to pull the stick with.</p>
<p>This effect is mostly seen when controlling the aircraft during high G maneuvers
and can prevent accidentally pulling extreme Gs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 As an example, in certain situations it would require beyond human strength
to pull the stick all the way back. With this set, when pulling the real
joystick beyond that limit, the in-game flight stick is limited and not pulled
equally aft. This also prevents for example accidentally pulling 20 G and
instantly blacking out, just because the real joystick has no, or reduced,
force feedback.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="stick-force-blending"><a class="header" href="#stick-force-blending">Stick Force Blending</a></h2>
<p>When maximum movement of the stick would result in excessive forces being
generated, having this activated will scale down the generated force to improve
handling precision, but also can help to prevent accidentally pulling extreme
Gs.</p>
<h2 id="afcs-breakout-deadzone"><a class="header" href="#afcs-breakout-deadzone">AFCS Breakout Deadzone</a></h2>
<p>Percentage of stick input (separate for roll and pitch) after which the AFCS
system will recognize the pilot stick was moved from neutral trim position
(force transducer switches closed).</p>
<p>This will affect the AFCS roll and pitch channel operation and prevent it from
fighting your input. That is, when moving the stick beyond this deadzone, the
AFCS understands that the pilot wants to take control and the AFCS will stop
trying to correct the movement. The roll breakout will temporarily disable the
roll stab aug as well as bank angle hold and heading hold. The pitch breakout
will temporarily disable the pitch attitude hold as well altitude hold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 This deadzone is <em>"on top"</em> of the DCS axis deadzone so the higher basic
deadzone set on the axis, the smaller the AFCS breakout deadzone should be
set. Keep in mind that setting low values, such as 0%, while having an already
low basic deadzone can result in some of the autopilot functions not engaging
even when letting go the stick because the stick may still be not perfectly
neutral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Default values are 1% for roll and 2% for pitch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To check whether the breakout is currently activated you can use the
controls indicator and look for the text below it.</p>

<h2 id="afterburner-detent"><a class="header" href="#afterburner-detent">Afterburner Detent</a></h2>
<p>Two options to define at which point of the physical hardware throttle input (0
to 100%) the aircraft will light the afterburner.</p>
<p>That is, if set to 80%, the MIL power range of the aircraft will be commanded
between 0% and 80% of your physical throttle, while the remaining 20% will
control the afterburner range.</p>
<p>The deadzone option can be used to split the points in the range at which the
afterburner will be turned on and off. For example, setting 20‰ for the deadzone
and 80% for the detent results in afterburner activation at 82% and deactivation
at 78% of throttle input.</p>

<p>If checked, when joining as WSO in multiplayer with a human pilot, your local
controls inputs (stick, rudder pedals and throttle) will be ignored by default.
You can toggle your local input back with assigned keybind.</p>
<h2 id="jester-landing-callouts"><a class="header" href="#jester-landing-callouts">Jester Landing Callouts</a></h2>
<p>If enabled, Jester will assist the pilot during landing by calling out aircraft

</blockquote>
<h2 id="hb-ui"><a class="header" href="#hb-ui">HB UI</a></h2>
<h3 id="resolution-override"><a class="header" href="#resolution-override">Resolution Override</a></h3>
<p>User interface elements, such as the Jester Wheel, the manual, virtual browser
and others are scaled and positioned via a fixed resolution that must match the
resolution of the in-game surface they are rendered on.</p>
<p>With the option unchecked, this resolution is automatically determined based on
screen settings. However, in certain situations, especially when using VR or
having a multi-monitor setup, this automatic detection might fail and compute an
incorrect resolution.</p>
<p>Should UI elements be misplaced, for example the Jester Wheel not being centered
or even cut off, check this setting and edit the resolution manually until the
UI is displayed properly.</p>
<h3 id="offset"><a class="header" href="#offset">Offset</a></h3>
<p>Allows to displace the UI horizontally and vertically. Positive values shift it
to the right or down, negative values to the left or up.</p>
<p>Normally, this should be kept at the default value of 0 px. However, in certain
cases (e.g. when using VR and setting it to render on the LEFT or RIGHT eye,
while having the checkbox for <em>"Use DCS System Resolution"</em> not checked) it is
possible that the UI gets cut off. This setting then allows to move the UI back
into view, but therefore giving up proper alignment on the UI, such as the
Jester UI being centered on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="domain-access"><a class="header" href="#domain-access">Domain Access</a></h3>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/hb_ui_domain_access_option.jpg" alt="Domain Access Types" /></p>
<p>Defines which domains the HB UI is allowed to access.</p>
<p><strong>Full</strong> allows for free browsing, allowing to visit any website with the
<a href="dcs/virtual_browser.html">Virtual Browser</a>.</p>
<p>The default option <strong>Whitelist</strong> defines which sites can be accessed by using a
whitelist file. Only domains passing the rules setup in the file are allowed.
The default rules are setup to support all HB UI features and a hand full of
useful websites for the Virtual Browser, such as <em>YouTube</em>.</p>
<p>This file is automatically created at</p>
<p><code>C:\Users\John Doe\Saved Games\DCS_F4E\hbui_whitelist.txt</code></p>
<p>when launching the Phantom for the first time.</p>
<p>Selecting <strong>Offline</strong> will disable the Virtual Browser and any other HB UI
features and elements that require an active online connection.</p>
<h3 id="theme"><a class="header" href="#theme">Theme</a></h3>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/special_option_hb_ui_theme.jpg" alt="UI Theme" /></p>
<p>Allows to select which color theme is used by the UI. All UI elements support a
light and a dark theme.</p>
<p>The default option <strong>AUTO</strong> will pick the theme dynamically based on the in-game
time. Light during the day and Dark for a night mission.</p>
<h2 id="jester-ui"><a class="header" href="#jester-ui">Jester UI</a></h2>
<h3 id="allow-mouse-controls"><a class="header" href="#allow-mouse-controls">Allow Mouse Controls</a></h3>
<p>When checked, the Jester UI allows interaction with the mouse moving it over
items and left clicking.</p>
<p>The option can be disabled if for example only head-tracking is preferred and
the automatic mouse detection is perhaps triggering too often, e.g. when having
placed the mouse on the arm of the chair.</p>
<h3 id="allow-head-tracking"><a class="header" href="#allow-head-tracking">Allow Head-Tracking</a></h3>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/special_options_jester_ui_head_tracking.jpg" alt="Radio Menu" /></p>
<p>When checked, the Jester UI allows moving the cursor simply by moving the
in-game character head. Can be disabled if no convenient head-tracking
equipment, such as TrackIR or VR, is available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Tracking options are chosen dynamically based on movement. Even if
head-tracking is enabled, other options such as using the mouse or assigning
the cursor to an axis are also still available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dropdown allows selection of the head-tracking behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Center - the view-origin is at the aircraft center</li>
<li>Dynamic - the view-origin is where the UI was opened</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting <em>Center</em> requires looking forward when operating the UI, whereas
<em>Dynamic</em> allows using head-tracking from any view position. However, <em>Dynamic</em>
can lead to having to chase the cursor when closing and re-opening the UI
frequently. Also, the <em>Dynamic</em> option is less meaningful in VR, as the UI
elements are then all rendered on the front always.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Jester Dialogs always use the <em>Center</em> type, requiring to look forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="max-angle"><a class="header" href="#max-angle">Max Angle</a></h4>
<p>Defines the angle (in degrees) the head has to be moved off-center to reach the
corners of the UI.</p>
<p>In other words, reducing this value from its default of 10° makes head-tracking
more sensitive to head movement, while increasing it will reduce the
sensitivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 VR users might find a lower angle more comfortable, since the head-to-game
translation is normally 1:1 in VR.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="deadzone"><a class="header" href="#deadzone">Deadzone</a></h4>
<p>Defines the angle (in degrees) the head has to be moved off-center to for the UI
to recognize head-movement and engage head-tracking.</p>
<p>If the head is moved less than the deadzone (0.5° by default), the cursor is
automatically set to the center instead and not moved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Users playing with a high and very sensitive head-to-game translation might
find it useful to increase this value slightly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="origin-angle-y-offset"><a class="header" href="#origin-angle-y-offset">Origin Angle Y-Offset</a></h4>
<p>Defines the offset (in degrees) to displace the center point of head-tracking
vertically. Positive values shift it up, negative values down. The default
setting is 0°.</p>
<p>This setting can be useful if the center point should not be properly lined up
with the natural forward view. That is, when opening the menu from a natural
head position and the cursor already shows a displacement instead of being
centered, tweaking this setting mitigates the issue.</p>
<h2 id="radar-stick-for-cursor"><a class="header" href="#radar-stick-for-cursor">Radar Stick for Cursor</a></h2>
<p>When checked, the binds mapped to control the
<a href="dcs/../cockpit/wso/right_console/front_section.html#antenna-hand-control">Antenna Hand Control</a>
can also be used to move the cursor used for Offset Bombing and similar, making
binding the two
<a href="dcs/../cockpit/wso/right_console/center_section.html#along-track-wheel">Track Wheels</a>
obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="ffb-gain"><a class="header" href="#ffb-gain">FFB Gain</a></h2>
<p>For users with force-feedback sticks, this setting can be used to adjust the
gain of the forces per axis.</p>
<p>The default setting is 100% for Roll and Pitch axis. Greater values will
increase the force used by the stick, while smaller values will decrease it.</p>
<h2 id="lower-simulation-update-rate"><a class="header" href="#lower-simulation-update-rate">Lower Simulation Update Rate</a></h2>
<p>This <strong>experimental option</strong> allows reducing the update rate of the majority of
the planes components.</p>
<p>Doing so may reduce the stress on the CPU, improving game performance for
machines that are bottlenecked by their CPU.</p>
<p>However, it can also result in not only visual cuts, such as animations running
slower, but will also cause some systems to degrade. For example the Pave Spike,
running slower, can not update its ground stabilization algorithm fast enough
anymore. So ticking this option can cause issues and lead to bugs.</p>
<h2 id="lower-hb-ui-refresh-rate"><a class="header" href="#lower-hb-ui-refresh-rate">Lower HB UI Refresh Rate</a></h2>
<p>When checked, all HB UI elements are rendered at a significantly lower rate.</p>
<p>This can help improving performance while HB UI elements are shown by reducing
CPU load. However, it can also cause UI animations to not look smooth anymore.</p>

<h2 id="example-run"><a class="header" href="#example-run">Example run</a></h2>
<p>This is a step-by-step guide for an example loft bombing run with 12 Mk-82s. In
our case we want the fourth bomb to hit the target. The first three should hit
in front of the target and the rest should impact behind the target. For that we
will use the release advance.</p>
<h3 id="planning-advance"><a class="header" href="#planning-advance">Planning: Advance</a></h3>
<p>The first step in planning our loft bombing run is to identify and pick a
target. In this example run we want to bombard the red units standing on the X.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_target_position.jpg" alt="map_target_position" /></p>
<h3 id="planning-ip"><a class="header" href="#planning-ip">Planning: IP</a></h3>
<p>In the second step we will take a look at the F10-Map and make out an Identification
Point (IP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The IP should always have a good visibility while flying the plane as
optical identification of the IP will be the main method of timing the press
of the bomb button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_ingress_point.jpg" alt="map_ingress_point" /></p>
<p>For our target we chose the lake just north of the target as an IP. Now we
measure the distance from our IP to the target and note it down as we need to
input that to the bombing calculator. In this case the distance is 4.03 NM which
we will cut off to 4 NM since the bombing calculator can only take 10ths of a
mile.</p>
<h3 id="planning-target"><a class="header" href="#planning-target">Planning: Target</a></h3>
<p>Now we also need to note the elevation of the target in MSL. To get that
information we just click on a unit and read the altitude out of the box in the
lower left corner. In this case the target elevation is 32 ft which we will cut
down to 30 ft since the bombing calculator can only take values of tens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If the target unit is not visible on the F10 map you can also hover over
the position of the enemy unit and read the elevation next to the coordinates
in the upper left corner of the map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/map_target_elevation.jpg" alt="map_target_elevation" /></p>
<h3 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h3>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/f4_bombing_calc_example.jpg" alt="bombing_calculator_numbered" /></p>
<p>Now that we have all needed values from the map we will put those in the bombing
calculator.</p>
<p>(<num>1</num>) Here we can select the mode of delivery which is LOFT in our example.</p>
<p>(<num>2</num>) Here we select the type of our bomb. In our case Mk-82s.</p>
<p>(<num>3</num>) We want to do our run-in at 350 knots true Airspeed.</p>
<p>(<num>4</num>) For our run-in altitude we want it to be at 3000 ft above MSL.</p>
<p>(<num>5</num>) We measured the distance between our Ingress Point and target
earlier at the second step. Now we will put that in.</p>
<p>(<num>6</num>) We got our target altitude from the F10 map and can put it in
now.</p>
<p>(<num>7</num>) We want our Loft Angle to be at 30°, we put that in.</p>
<p>(<num>8</num>) The bombing calculator now gives us back the Pull-Up Timer that
the WSO can than put in at a later step. Alternatively it can be transferred via the "Tell Jester
and close" or the "Tell Jester" Button.</p>
<p>(<num>9</num>) The bombing calculator also gives us the Pullup Range. This is only as pilot
information.</p>
<p>(<num>10</num>) Further as a pilot information the bombing calculator gives us our release range.</p>
<p>(<num>11</num>) We want to drop our bombs with a release Interval of 0.15
seconds, so we put that in</p>
<p>(<num>12</num>) As we decided on the beginning we want the fourth bomb to be on
the target.</p>
<p>(<num>13</num>) In the release advance window the bombing calculator now gives
us the value that the WSO can put in later.</p>

<h2 id="spotting-circle"><a class="header" href="#spotting-circle">Spotting Circle</a></h2>
<p>To aid in crew coordination, during startup and planning, a commonly employed
technique is to select a static object at distance, such as a building, vehicle
or tree, and drawing a circle around it.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/spotting_circle_setup.jpg" alt="Spotting Circle Setup" /></p>
<p>The circle drawn by the Pilot and the WSO will now roughly point in the same
direction and, once in air, can be used to enhance coordination.</p>
<p>For example, if the Pilot spots a target, they can tell the WSO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is a target 100m right to the circle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WSO can now use his circle marker to locate the right spot.</p>

<p>Although not present in the real Phantom, our aircraft is equipped with a Tape
Player to listen and rock to great tunes in-flight!</p>
<p>Therefore, the <strong>Airborne Video Tape Recorder</strong> doubles as recorder and, if
inserting a special music cassette, as music player.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/tape_player_cassette.jpg" alt="Music Cassette" /></p>

<h2 id="controls-5"><a class="header" href="#controls-5">Controls</a></h2>
<p>The AVTR and most of its controls are to the right of the pilot seat, see
<a href="dcs/../cockpit/pilot/right_console/aft_section.html#airborne-video-tape-recorder">2.1.10.3 AVTR System</a>
for details. Status lights and its mode switch can be found on the main panel in
the WSO cockpit, see
<a href="dcs/../cockpit/wso/left_sub_panel.html#avtr-control">2.2.2 AVTR Control</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Jester can set the mode from his UI under <em>"Systems &gt; AVTR Recorder"</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To swap the cassettes, the AVTR first has to be turned off by setting its mode
to OFF. Then, the EJECT button can be pressed to open the cassette holder.</p>
<p>Once the cassette is out, it can be swapped by clicking on it. Insert the
cassette back by left-clicking the holder.</p>
<p>With the music tape loaded, songs can be played by setting the mode switch to
RECORD. The RECORDER ON lamp next to the pilots left knee indicates the status
and rotating it will adjust the volume.</p>
<p>The AVTR shows the soundtrack currently playing on its display for Elapsed Time,
e.g. <code>M01</code> for the first track. Tracks can be skipped by using either the
UNTHREAD button or by clicking on the RCD/EOT lamp in the WSO cockpit.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/tape_player_track_display.jpg" alt="Track Display" /></p>
<p>If the tape has finished playing all songs, the EOT lamp illuminates and
explicitly commanding the next track will start the first track again.</p>
<h2 id="custom-songs"><a class="header" href="#custom-songs">Custom Songs</a></h2>
<p>The Tape Player automatically fetches any song found in</p>
<p><code>&lt;DCS Install Folder&gt;\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\TapePlayer</code></p>

<p><code>&lt;DCS Install Folder&gt;\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\sdef\TapePlayer</code></p>
<p>To add your own songs, simply put them into the above folder and create the
corresponding SDEF file. Make sure to restart DCS, as sounds are loaded during
start of the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If you have trouble getting a custom song to work, try out the file format
<strong>OGG</strong> for the sound file. Also make sure the file names do not contain any

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mission-editor"><a class="header" href="#mission-editor">Mission Editor</a></h1>
<p>The F-4 has several special options selectable in the Mission Editor.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/mission_editor_special_options.jpg" alt="Special Options" /></p>
<h2 id="condition-and-wear"><a class="header" href="#condition-and-wear">Condition and Wear</a></h2>
<p><em>"And I'll tell you what, since Cal's on it, it's only flown on approved
cross-countries and drill weekends. Mint condition, folks, no over-Gs."</em></p>
<p>All components of the aircraft simulate wear individually, yielding a unique
experience on each spawn, but also based on how the F-4 is flown.</p>
<p>It is generally differentiated between <strong>Condition</strong> and the <strong>Wear and Tear</strong>,
both are dynamic at spawn and can be influenced throughout a mission by various
factors such as forces, temperature and also combat damage.</p>
<p>The aircraft has thousands of components that are subject to this system. One
concrete example would be the speed of the Pave Spike Targeting Pod elevation
gimbal motor. Under perfect condition, it is supposed to have a speed of 60
degrees per second. However, a factory generally can not ensure this to always
be the case and accepts a variance, for example it must be within 1% error.</p>
<p>Mathematically, variance is simulated as <strong>normal distribution</strong>, consisting of
the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>μ (Mu, mean) - the value it would have under perfect condition</li>
<li>σ (Sigma) - the variance of the value</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/normal_distribution.jpg" alt="Normal Distribution" /></p>
<p>Around 70% of times the value will be within one unit of σ, in 95% of cases it
will be within 2 units of σ. Extreme cases above 3 units of σ are possible, but
very rare.</p>
<p>Said motor has for example a σ value of 3% around 60 degrees per second, meaning
that the vast majority of targeting pods will be produced with a motor capable
of moving the elevation gimbal between 58 and 62 degrees per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Variance goes in both directions, your Phantom can also be faster than it
is supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aircraft-condition"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-condition">Aircraft Condition</a></h3>
<p>An aircraft's condition generally refers to its factory and production quality.
For example, during war times a factory might run out of supplies and reduce
their acceptance criteria during production, generally increasing variance in
individual component performance.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Condition</strong>
slider, indicating quality from 0% (poor quality) to 100% (high quality).</p>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 0%, its speed variance σ
will increase from 3% to 8%, causing majority of pods to be produced with a
speed between 55 and 65 degrees per second instead.</p>
<p>Aircraft condition will always still be within limits that a manufacturer might
find reasonably acceptable. The aircraft is always still fully functional and
operational.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-wear-and-tear"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-wear-and-tear">Aircraft Wear and Tear</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to production quality, components can degrade during service based
on time since the last overhaul, external factors like temperature and weather,
aggressive flying involving a lot of forces on the airframe, as well as combat
damage.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Wear and Tear</strong>
slider, indicating wear from 0% (no wear) to 100% (a lot of wear), or even
beyond that. For an aircraft that was just repaired and came fresh out of
service, 0% is appropriate. 100% refers to the latest point at which an aircraft
would reasonably be send back for maintenance, as it starts being less effective
in practice. Values beyond, such as 500%, can be used to represent scenarios in
which pilots are forced to fly an aircraft that operates exceptionally below its
expected performance level. It is still somewhat usable, nothing is straight out
broken, but components just do not behave within acceptable parameters anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Values beyond 100% cannot be set in the Mission Editor, but are achievable
in-flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 100% wear, its speed
variance σ will additionally increase by 20%. Assuming a good initial starting
condition, the motor will at that point likely operate between 45 and 75 degrees
per second.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/broken_phantom_crash.jpg" alt="Crashed Phantom" /></p>
<h3 id="reference-aircraft"><a class="header" href="#reference-aircraft">Reference Aircraft</a></h3>
<p>The variance system at initial spawn can be turned off with this checkbox, if
desired. Components will then start with their mean value μ, without any
variance.</p>
<p>That is, with the option checked the setting for condition, as well as wear and
tear are ignored and disabled. The aircraft will spawn with all properties set
exactly as specified by the manufacturer and according to documentation, without
any variance.</p>
<p>This is especially interesting for competitions, where both sides should start
with the same conditions for fairness. Or when performing tests and computing
performance charts, where the aircraft should always start with the exact same
values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Even the reference aircraft is still subject to wear and tear during
flight. In a competition, if you pull high Gs, your aircraft's component
properties will deviate from your opponents.</p>

<h2 id="ins-reference-alignment-stored"><a class="header" href="#ins-reference-alignment-stored">INS Reference Alignment Stored</a></h2>
<p>This checkbox allows significant reduction of the time needed for a proper INS
alignment during cold-start.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ground crew would previously have started the aircraft and
executed a full alignment, then shut it down again, while memorizing parts of
the alignment data.</p>

<p>It is possible to set up a station in the Mission Editor for use in ADF
navigation. To do this, a unit, such as a ground station, needs to be placed on
the map. This unit should then execute a command to tune into the desired AM
frequency (<em>Perform Command &gt; Set Frequency</em>). Finally, the unit must transmit a
message continuously throughout the mission, which requires setting the message
to loop (<em>Perform Command &gt; Transmit Message</em>).</p>

number (e.g., "01" for waypoint 1, "12" for waypoint 12), and "Y" is the flight plan number (default
is 1 if not specified). The waypoint designations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 -&gt; Default</li>
<li>1 -&gt; CAP</li>
<li>2 -&gt; IP</li>
<li>3 -&gt; Target</li>
<li>4 -&gt; VIP</li>
<li>5 -&gt; Silent VIP</li>
<li>6 -&gt; Fence IN</li>
<li>7 -&gt; Fence Out</li>
<li>8 -&gt; Homebase</li>
<li>9 -&gt; Alternate</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, "0.005" indicates turn point 5 in flight plan 1 with a Default designation, while "
0.3102" represents turn point 10 in flight plan 2 with a Target designation.</p>
<h4 id="jester_set_cap_time"><a class="header" href="#jester_set_cap_time">Jester_set_cap_time</a></h4>
<p>The value sets the CAP time for the active CAP pair in the format "0.XX," where "XX" represents the
number of minutes. For example, "0.05" corresponds to 5 minutes, and "0.12" corresponds to 12
minutes.</p>
<h4 id="wrcs-entries-and-laser-code"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-entries-and-laser-code">WRCS Entries and Laser Code</a></h4>
<p>The WRCS Entries are used from 0.999 to 0.000 where 0.999 is the biggest value the WRCS can feature.
For Jester_set_wrcs_ew_dist and Jester_set_wrcs_ns_dist the s is for - . When a negative value is
entered it will put in West or South values respectively.</p>
<p>The laser code can be set by entering a valid laser code for XXXX. Note that Jester will not enter
invalid codes and will not respond in any way other than not entering the laser code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="training-missions"><a class="header" href="#training-missions">Training Missions</a></h1>
<h2 id="lessons"><a class="header" href="#lessons">Lessons</a></h2>
<p>These missions, we like to call them "lessons", have been designed in such a way that, as a
beginner, everything important that you need for a successful start with your new F-4E Phantom II is
explained.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-goals"><a class="header" href="#lesson-goals">Lesson goals</a></h2>
<p>The stated goal of these lessons is that after completing them once or several times, you can
say: "Hey, I think I now know how this thing works (again)".
You can use the lessons as "initial training" or as so-called "recurrent training". Whenever
you haven't flown for a long time and need a refresher. By the way: We recommend a refresher
every 90 days at least.</p>
<p>Please note that the lessons require a certain level of knowledge about DCS and also some basic
flying skills. In the
lessons we don't explain flying as such, but rather the aircraft, its systems and their usage, and
the behavior. The lessons may therefore be understood as a kind of "interactive type training in the
cockpit" and not as a "basic flying training".</p>
<h2 id="your-way-through"><a class="header" href="#your-way-through">Your way through</a></h2>
<p>Due to the design, systems and age of the jet, it has many pecularities. Precise application of
system knowledge in daily duty on this wonderful aircraft is the key to success. With the F-4E
Phantom II you will be challenged in so many ways. So be ready! We leave it up to you whether you
want to get in the air immediately without studying the manual, or whether you want to read upon it
before your first flight.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to fly immediately, the training lessons will provide you with enough knowledge to
successfully complete these flights. You can even study this section or other parts of the manual
during your flights; this is another innovation in the DCS F-4E Phantom II. The lessons can be
paused at any time if necessary. Of course, you are welcome to practice multi-tasking and fly at the
same time as studying the manual; that's not explicitly forbidden! Learning by doing is the basic
strategy for the training lessons, but you will be required to read through the manual and carefully
study the systems if you want to become a real pro.</p>
<h2 id="procedures"><a class="header" href="#procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
<p>We have depicted the most important "normal procedures" of the aircraft and have based the lessons
very much on reality. These procedures should also be based as closely as possible on the real
procedures, although we were aware that it wouldn't be possible to implement everything in the
simulation. Think, for example, of the ejection seat harness, the oxygen mask and its test, the
transponder, the IFF system, or similar systems. Some steps are left out because they are already
set correctly after spawning the aircraft and to really speed up the lesson to get you in the air;
of course you may check them as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, not all procedures are depicted as can be found in real aircraft manuals; some of
them had to be changed, shortened, or omitted entirely. Nevertheless, for example, we
simulated putting on the helmet (including sun protection visor and sun glasses), an immersive
innovation in DCS.</p>
<h2 id="our-way-through"><a class="header" href="#our-way-through">Our way through</a></h2>
<p>We thought a lot about how best to explain the operation of such a complex aircraft with training
missions. Where do you start, where do you end? How detailed should it be so that a "nerd" doesn't
miss anything, how superficial can it be so that a "leisure gamer" doesn't lose interest? How tight
are the checks whether the player is adhering to the procedures and the planned flight route? A
basic idea at Heatblur has always been to get players "in the air" as quickly as possible, without
them having to spend hours watching introductory videos or studying thick books. All of this caused
us a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>In any case, we spared no expense, effort and discussions to serve both types of players more or
less "equally". As you can imagine, such a project is not entirely trivial, and you have to make a
lot of compromises when designing the lessons. Sometimes, you have to tell hardliners: "Hey, this
might be too difficult for the players and not really relevant to the simulation, eventhough it
would be extra cool!" You have to convince other team members to do things they personally don't
like: Hey, that's exactly what the players need, but a little different please!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had professional help from SME's (real former Phantom pilots and weapons systems
officer and even instructors). These guys helped us with so many decisions, and spiced the product
with their knowledge and experience. Conversely, they slapped us on the wrist if we left out
something they thought was important.</p>
<p>In a complex development process that such a high-quality DCS module requires, there are many
obstacles and limitations, but also many opportunities and possibilities. That's why we made it a
point right from the start to present the handling of the aircraft's systems as comprehensively as
possible.</p>
<p>We hope you like what you have in hands now!</p>

<h2 id="general-tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#general-tips--tricks">General Tips &amp; Tricks</a></h2>
<p>It rarely happens that you get stuck in a procedure, or you don't know what to do
next.</p>
<p>Here are some general tips &amp; tricks as created by testers during the testing phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>For lessons starting on the ground, the noise might be very loud. You have three options:
<ul>
<li>Wait until the other jets have taken off before beginning with the lesson.</li>
<li>You are allowed to close the canopy whenever you need to (default binding is LCTRL+C), despite
the F-4 usually closes it very lately</li>
<li>Adjust the audio volume of DCS to suite the audio hardware you are using.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have troubles with a very dark cockpit, a few things can be done:
<ul>
<li>Use the internal cockpit illumination on the COCKPIT LIGHTS panel (right side):
<ul>
<li>The CONSOLE OFF/BRT knob</li>
<li>The INSTR PANEL knob</li>
<li>The CONSOLE FLOOD light switch</li>
<li>The INST FLOOD light switch</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/training_mission_cockpit_lights.jpg" alt="training_tips_illumination_pic" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Cockpit Global Illumination" to ON</li>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Gamma" to 2.0 or higher values.</li>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Shadows" off as the very last resort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lesson-got-stuck"><a class="header" href="#lesson-got-stuck">Lesson got stuck</a></h2>
<p>There are situations in which the triggers of a lesson no longer work properly for some reason.
Fortunately, this only happens very rarely! This usually results in the highlights (the
yellow helper boxes) no longer being shown or hidden correctly, or the logic circuits no longer
reacting correctly to events in the simulation. We experienced this ourselves during the testing
phase from time to time, and we would like to at least inform you about here and now.</p>
<p>The influence of the time acceleration function on the stability of the lessons is not documented,
but to be on the safe side we advise against using the time acceleration function.</p>
<p>If you got stuck in a lesson, you should take the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay calm!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether everything in the aircraft is actually set up as required according to the
checklist/procedure. If necessary, check each of the previous steps individually and carefull,
starting from the top by asking yourself the following questions:
"What is written in the procedure/checklist/book?" and "How did I set it up?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help:
Jump back one - or if necessary - a few steps (if that lesson supports jumping back via the comms
menu &gt; F-10 Other ...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help either:
Jump back to the beginning of the procedure (if that lesson supports jumping back via the comms
menu &gt; F-10 Other ...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all that doesn't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quit the mission and save the DEBRIEFING (log-file) and the TRACK (trk-file) in the
debriefing screen</li>
<li>If you suspect a bug, please open a new ticker in the DCS forum &gt; Heatblur Simulations &gt;
Phantom area using this link: <a href="https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/">https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/</a>. Please
add as much information as possible in order to help us finding a possible issue. Thank
you for your support!</li>
<li>In any case, we recommend to restart DCS and fly the mission again. Sorry for that!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="training-area-kobuleti-ug5x-airfield"><a class="header" href="#training-area-kobuleti-ug5x-airfield">Training area: Kobuleti (UG5X) airfield</a></h2>
<p>The entire F-4E Phantom II training will be held in Kobuleti in Georgia.
The choice fell on an airfield in the Caucasus region for understandable reasons, as this map is
delivered with DCS as standard. The training areas in the south of Georgia (designated
as "Training Area W" and "Training Area E") offer a sufficiently large playground for training,
including supersonic flights.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Georgia_Training_Area.jpg" alt="training_area" /></p>
<p>The airfield has a picturesque location between the mountains to the south and the Black Sea
to the west. Here is a photo of the airfield, taken a month ago from a helicopter, looking in
direction S-W.</p>

<h3 id="lesson-01a---weather"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---weather">Lesson 01a - Weather</a></h3>
<p>The weather has been bad in the last few days. A persistent Black Sea depression had brought a
lot of rain. However, stabilization occurred last night because dry air mass flows in from the
east. The mid-level cloud layer is expected to break up. The weather forecast predicts that the
clouds will no longer be a problem in about an hour and the temperature will rise quickly due to
strong sunshine. However, ground-level haze is still to be expected as the ground has stored a lot
of moisture and heavy evaporation from the sun is to be expected.</p>

<p>Your fellow pilots will begin their flights immediately, your flight a little later. The airfield is
a very noisy environment, so wait until the jets positioned on the runway have taken off
before beginning with your lesson. Then the noise level should be somewhat tolerable ... hopefully.</p>
<p>Currently registered sorties for this afternoon:</p>

<p>The technician responsible for the aircraft, also called the "crew chief", is already in front of
your aircraft and waiting to support you. You can communicate with him using the Jester menu &gt; CREW
CHIEF. Don' confuse the "crew chief" with Jester. Sometimes they sound very similar when heard
over the intercom, but in fact you are dealing with two different persons!</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson01_Crew_chief_Ramp_no25.jpg" alt="lesson01a_crew_chief" /></p>
<p>By the way, the crew chief's assistant is standing by on your left side, next to the Dash-60 ground

<p>You've just sat down on the ejection seat and are starting to check the cockpit. You may be
thinking:
"Damn, I'm totally blown away by what I see, but I guess I don't know what I'm doing ...".</p>

The tasks for this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Check the aircraft and essential switches before applying external power.</li>

<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 01a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 4:
Let the instructor speak to the end of each instruction, there is enough time for the
actions to be carried out.</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step 4b:
Be careful when opening the fuel, this should not be done before 10% RPM! If you see the
EGT rising above 700°C, immediately cut off the fuel by moving the throttle lever to the
"OFF" position. Note: engine parameters may vary slightly depending on the environmental
conditions, but only the EGT value must be monitored closely!</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step 4c:
Make sure you pull the throttle lever in the simulation back to "IDLE" position in order for
the lesson logic to continue. The background is the following: Users reported about problems
when performing this step. In all cases reported so far, the real throttle lever was pulled
back to (its) IDLE position, but the throttle lever in the simulation did not reach the
"IDLE" position, but became stuck a bit too far forward.
Therefore, please make sure that your real throttle levers are able to move the throttle levers
in the sim over the whole range:
<ul>
<li>"MAX" (which is 100% RPM with full afterburner)</li>
<li>"MIL" (which is 100% RPM without afterburner)</li>
<li>"IDLE" (which is 65% RPM)</li>
<li>"OFF" (which is fuel shut off)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step "STARTING ENGINES PROCEDURE" checklist:
Make sure all controls are still set to their commanded positions, which have been set in all the
other procedures before. Users reported problems about advancing, because they accidentally set
some controls to unexpected/false positions.</li>

<p>Caused by an accident on the taxiway "S" just before your flight, it was decided to close the
taxiway.
Therefore, a new temporary ramp position, which is located directly on the
threshold runway 07, was established. You will take off from that location and then divert to
Vaziani.</p>

<p>The lessons are divided into tasks, which are based on the names of the procedures. These
tasks are divided into individual steps, whereby the steps go hand in hand with the individual
items in the procedure. The tasks for this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1: Check the aircraft before moving on own power.</p>
</li>

<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 02:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7:
The flight controls check can be omitted in case it becomes too difficult. Use the FIRE
TEST BUTTON on the instrument panel before or during performing this check to skip it. The
reason for this is that for this check a few things have to be done in parallel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to our instructor</li>
<li>Performing the inputs on the flight control system (movements and button/switch
presses/settings)</li>
<li>Listening to the confirmation given by the crew chief</li>
<li>Pressing "Spacebar" after receiving the crew chief's confirmation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7f &amp; 7h: The crew chief will not respond when you set the rudder to the neutral
position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Introduction:
Observe that the audio containing the taxi clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signal to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1a)
Use the power levers very gently! Once the aircraft started rolling, pull back the power
levers to idle and carefully control the taxi speed using minimum power together with
the wheel brakes.</p>

<h3 id="lesson-03---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-03---tips--tricks">Lesson 03 - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 03:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Steps 4a - 4e:
The flight controls check only requires to check if the stick is moving freely (at least 50%
of the stick deflection must be made). You can also check the rudder, but this is not
required by that step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 10:
Having the MASTER CAUTION alert active indicates something is or at least was wrong. So
reset it, then check if it stays out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1:
Observe that the audio containing the line-up clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Introduction
Observe that the audio containing the take-off clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 5:
For beginners, we recommend to perform the first take-off without afterburner (just MIL
power, which means 100% rpm without afterburner), despite we know that taking off with
afterburner is a ton of fun. The reason behind is, that you will then be able to hear all
call-outs of your instructor, because the time needed for the take-off is long enough.
Whenever you think you manage all steps by heart that are necessary for a safe take-off
without any instructions, go for a take-off with afterburner. Please don't tell our SME's
that this text exists at all, and never tell someone that you have followed the
recommendation ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take-off:
Before taking off, go through the takeoff procedure. You need to remember the items by heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>No NGS after 70 knots</li>
<li>Full aft STICK by 80 knots</li>
<li>Hold 10 to 12° NOSE UP</li>
<li>Raise the GEAR &amp; FLAPS as soon as airborne</li>
<li>TRIM as needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 8:
In DCS, with the current wind situation (no cross wind component), it is really not
necessary to use the nose gear steering. You will only be reminded by the instructor in case
you use the nose gear steering above 70 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 11:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid over-
trimming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Steps 13:
Make sure to have flaps retracted before reaching 250 knots, but there is a certain safety
buffer and they should not be damaged at exactly 250 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 5 &gt; Step 1:
Make sure to fly a heading of about 064° and climb after lift-off.
Make sure to fly at an airspeed of not more than 350 knots.
Fly a shallow climb when using no afterburner (about 10° pitch angle).
Fly a steep climb when using afterburner (about 30° pitch angle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reaching a certain altitude and airspeed with gear and flaps up, the lesson is
accomplished. You may continue the climb following the route which is commanded by your
instructor. If you got "lost in space", open up the F-10 map, click on your aircraft, and
observe the planned flightroute; you may then follow it more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 6 &gt; Step 1d:
There is currently no way of comparing the values on both altimeters. This step was kept in
the procedure just in case you need it when operating with a real WSO in the rear seat.</p>

<p>The tasks for this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Check aircraft for landing while in cruise flight.</li>
<li>Task 2: Prepare the aircraft for landing while in the downwind RWY 07.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="lesson-04---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-04---tips--tricks">Lesson 04 - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 04:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the jet:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid
over-trimming.</li>
<li>Autopilot:
Use the autopilot modes "attitude hold" and "altitude hold" whenever you think you need your hands
free. The system is a great assistant, so use it!</li>
<li>DME distances:
DME distance information is shown on the lower left corner of the HSI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_HSI_DME.jpg" alt="lesson04_dme_distance" /></p>
<ul>
<li>HSI course settings:
The course setting can be changed with the COURSE SET KNOB on the lower right corner of the HSI:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_HSI_HDG.jpg" alt="lesson04_hsi_course" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 4:
If you can't reach the COMM Antenna Select Switch, move the throttles back for a moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/Lesson04_COMM_Antenna_switch.jpg" alt="lesson04_comm_antenna" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 8:
The transition altitude in this particular region is 4,000m (13,120 ft), and the transition level
is
flight level 140 (FL140, which is 14,000 feet). When you descend through 14,000 feet, you have to
set your altimeter to the value of the local QNH (which today is 29.84 in/HG). It's no big deal if
you forget about that, it is not relevant for the outcome of the lesson.</li>
<li>PENETRATION / DESCENT:
Follow the instructions as good as possible. You may engage the attitude hold autopilot during
descent and focus on airspeed and power management. Don't forget to set the QNH once passing the
transition level (in this case 14,000 feet).</li>
<li>PENETRATION / TURN:
Fly a shallow left turn. If you have already reached 2,500 feet altitude, good. If you are still
higher, continue descending during the left turn until reaching 2500 feet. Keep an eye on your
sink
rate. Fly smoothly, and don't work hard on the stick. Intercept radial 064 as good as you can in
order to align on the runway heading. Treat her like a lady, and think ahead! Use the F-10 map if
you got lost in space. Don't rush into Batumi airspace.
Landing permission is already given. You are the last flight approaching the airfield for the next
two hours.</li>
<li>Task 2:
Remember these five items by heart: GEAR / FLAPS / HYDRAULIC PRESSURE / WARNING LIGHTS / ANTI SKID</li>
<li>Task 3:
If you fly correct airspeeds, all instructions can be heard until the end. If you rush, the
timeline
becomes compressed and the sequence of events then may become overwhelming.
During the approach continuously cross check Pitch / Power / Trim. Look out for the runway, adjust
your heading with slight roll maneuvers if necessary. Rise the seat in case you have troubles
seeing
the runway at higher angles of attack. Fly gently, follow the instructions, and think ahead!</li>
<li>Go-around:
In case you have the slightest doubt that you cannot manage a safe landing: GO AROUND. Fly the
missed approach procedure by entering a short left hand traffic pattern at 1500 feet at 250 knots.
Take your time, be patient with yourself, don't rush and keep an eye on airspeed and altitude!</li>
<li>Landing / flare:
The aircraft was certified for carrier landings. If you don't flare before touchdown at a 2°
to 3° approach path, you WILL slam the aircraft into the runway. This causes wear to the wheels
and the landing gear legs, but nothing more. You may decide on your own if you want to flare just
a bit to decrease the sink rate slightly. Sink rates above 3 to 4 m/s (600 to 700 ft/min)
depending on weight, might damage the landing gear though.</li>
<li>Landing / touchdown:
Make sure to stay aligned with the centerline using rudder only. Prepare yourself to deploy the
drag chute, which stabilizes the aircraft during the landing roll. Taxi to the end of the runway
and then leave it to the right side!</li>
<li>Taxi:
Follow the marshaller after leaving the runway. If you struggle performing the "After landing
procedure " while taxiing, you may stop the aircraft on the taxi way for that. The car though
will not stop. When finished with the procedure, continue taxiing to your initial parking
position, nose pointed towards shelter "25", and stop there.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="tables"><a class="header" href="#tables">Tables</a></h3>
<p>Lua in itself is a fairly simple language with not too many features. It
primarily revolves around the use of tables. Tables can be compared to arrays,
lists and dictionaries, or maps.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- dictionary
local person = {
  name = "John",
  age = 20,
}

-- array/list
local fruits = { "Orange", "Apple", "Lemon" }
</code></pre>
<p>Arrays also implicitly decay to dictionaries with ascending keys <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Access can be either in a lookup-style <code>person["age"] = 21</code>, or like fields
<code>person.age = 21</code>.</p>
<p>In Lua, indices start <strong>counting at 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print(fruits[1]) -- Orange
</code></pre>
<p>The length of a table can be accessed using <code>#</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- appending to a table
fruits[#fruits + 1] = "Cherry"
</code></pre>
<p>Anything not explicitly set is given the value <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-example"><a class="header" href="#syntax-example">Syntax example</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function ageCheck(name, age)
  if age &lt; 18 then
    print("Sorry", name)
  else
    print("Okay", name)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h3 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h3>
<p>Lua itself does not provide classes. However, we created a framework to add
class-like structures to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')

local Person = Class()
Person.name = nil -- fields
Person.age = nil

function Person:Constructor(name, age)
  self.name = name
  self.age = age
end

Person:Seal() -- Prevent adding/removing more values/functions to it
</code></pre>
<p>The framework also supports inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')

local AssistAAR = Class(Behavior) -- inherits from Behavior
</code></pre>
<h2 id="debugging"><a class="header" href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have any Lua debugger setup. One has to rely on caveman
debugging with prints.</p>
<p>To aid in that, Jester offers an in-game console UI (<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>).
This console displays any string logged via <code>Log(...)</code>.</p>
<p>Further, it offers a console prompt allowing execution of Lua code.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/jester/../../../img/jester_console_hello_world.jpg" alt="jester_console_hello_world" /></p>
<p>The prompt can also be used to inspect the running code, for example by entering
a command such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Log(GetJester().behaviors[require('radar.MoveRadarAntenna')].current_antenna_degrees.value)
</code></pre>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/jester/../../../img/jester_console_inspect.jpg" alt="jester_console_inspect" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 HB UI does not support the full keyboard yet, for example <code>().[]:"'</code> cannot be entered.
It is thus recommended to prepare the prompt in an external text editor and simply
copy-paste it into the UI instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also provide a Lua playground in <code>WizardJester.lua</code>, which is always executed
directly on startup.</p>
<p>It is also possible to edit Lua files while DCS runs, without restarting the
game. Simply edit a LUA file and then reload the DCS mission with
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and the new Lua file will be effective.</p>
<h2 id="jester-api"><a class="header" href="#jester-api">Jester API</a></h2>
<p>Jesters logic is divided into 6 layers of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intention (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Plan (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>Behavior</li>
<li>Task</li>
<li>Action</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is placed in the Mod-Folder, for example:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Jester</code></p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>As an example that touches most of the layers, we want to create a feature that
lets Jester report the current speed every couple of seconds during flight.</p>
<p>Therefore, we start with a Situation. A situation needs an activation and
deactivation <strong>Condition:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Airborne.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Condition = require 'base.Condition'

local Airborne = {}
Airborne.True = Class(Condition)
Airborne.False = Class(Condition)

function IsAirborne()
  -- details on observations later
  return GetJester().awareness:GetObservation("airborne") or false
end

function Airborne.True:Check()
  return IsAirborne() -- activation condition
end

function Airborne.False:Check()
  return not IsAirborne() -- deactivation condition
end

Airborne.True:Seal()
Airborne.False:Seal()
return Airborne
</code></pre>
<p>Activation and deactivation conditions do not necessarily have to be the same.</p>
<p>Now, we can use this condition in our <code>Flight</code> situation and add our desired
behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Flight.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Situation = require 'base.Situation'
local Airborne = require 'conditions.Airborne'
local ReportSpeed = require 'behaviors.ReportSpeed'
-- behavior will be defined in the next step

local Flight = Class(Situation)

-- it simply expects a class with a :Check() method
Flight:AddActivationConditions(Airborne.True:new())
Flight:AddDeactivationConditions(Airborne.False:new())

function Flight:OnActivation()
  self:AddBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- start our behavior
end

function Flight:OnDeactivation()
  self:RemoveBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- stop our behavior
end

Flight:Seal()
return Flight
</code></pre>
<p>The situation also has to be registered in <code>F-4E_WSO.lua</code> (<em>WIP</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in F-4E_WSO.lua
...
function CreateF4E_WSOJester()
  ...
  wso::AddSituations(Flight:new())
  ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can define our behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')
-- Task will be defined in the next step

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- this is called periodically
  local task = SaySpeed:new(...) -- access to speed explained later
  GetJester():AddTask(task)
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this would let Jester say something on every tick, a bit too verbose. To
improve on this, the Urge-system has been created. We can wrap our task in an
<code>Urge</code> and it will only be called on a set interval (which is automatically
applied some variance based on Jesters fixation and stress level):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local Urge = require('base.Urge') -- added
local StressReaction = require('base.StressReaction') -- added
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)

  -- logic of the behavior
  local say_speed = function ()
    -- very simple in this case,
    -- but could also trigger multiple tasks based on conditions, if desired
    local task = SaySpeed:new(...)
    GetJester():AddTask(task)
    return {task}
  end

  -- define the urge
  self.urge = Urge:new({
    time_to_release = s(10), -- baseline interval (10s now)
    on_release_function = say_speed, -- what to execute
    stress_reaction = StressReaction.ignorance, -- how important is this to Jester
  })
  self.urge:Restart() -- start it
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- we could also modify the urge now, if desired
  -- for example increasing the stress level
  self.urge:Tick() -- tick it
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to create the actual Task that will take care of reporting the
given speed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- SaySpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Task = require('base.Task')
local SayAction = require('actions.SayAction')

local SaySpeed = Class(Task)

function SaySpeed:Constructor(speed)
  Task.Constructor(self)

  local on_activation = function()
    if speed &lt; kt(500) then
      -- see PhrasesList.txt for all supported voice lines
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/wereslow'))
    else
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/werefast'))
    end
  end

  self:AddOnActivationCallback(on_activation)
end

SaySpeed:Seal()
return SaySpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The last part is the final <code>Action</code>, in our case <code>SayAction</code>. Actions are
usually very generic and basic. In most cases, the existing <code>SayAction</code> will be
all thats needed. Refer to <code>SayAction.lua</code> for how it works.</p>
<p>If a behavior has no extra need for a specific task and just wants to say a
phrase, one can also directly use <code>SayTask</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in a Behaviors logic
...
local task = SayTask:new('misc/outoffuel')
GetJester():AddTask(task)
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lreal-and-units"><a class="header" href="#lreal-and-units">LReal and units</a></h3>
<p>A very common need is to work with real values and units, such as speed or time.
Therefore, we have <code>LReal</code>s, with units defined in <code>LUnit</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local time = min(15)
local speed = kt(500)
local fuel = lb(12000)

if time &gt; s(10) then
  print("foo")
end

time = time - s(40)
</code></pre>
<p>Careful when doing scalar operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- correct
time *= 2

-- incorrect
time *= s(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Latter would result in an invalid <code>LReal</code>, which can be checked for using
<code>time:IsValid()</code>.</p>
<p>If necessary, values can be converted to another unit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local timeInSeconds = time:ConvertTo(s)
print("Time:", timeInSeconds)
</code></pre>
<p><code>time.value</code> would access the raw underlying number.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-properties"><a class="header" href="#accessing-properties">Accessing properties</a></h3>
<p>Lua has full access to all <code>Property</code>s defined in our components and can access
them easily with <code>GetProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function GetTotalFuelQuantity()
  local gauge_readout = GetProperty(
    "/Pilot Fuel Quantity Indicator/Fuel Meter", -- path
    "Internal Fuel Quantity Indication" -- property name
  ).value

  return gauge_readout or lb(10000)
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>GetProperty</code> expects the full path to the component within the component-tree
(that are all names of parent components), they must start with <code>/</code> to
indicate an absolute path.</p>
<p>The returned value is a wrapper <code>Property</code> object. Access to the underlying
value (in this case a <code>LReal</code> with unit <code>Pounds</code>) is given by
<code>GetProperty(...).value</code>.</p>
<h3 id="observations-and-senses"><a class="header" href="#observations-and-senses">Observations and Senses</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to direct property access, Jester has an Observation-System. The
system allows to make frequently used data accessible in an easy way, or also to
provide more complex data, i.e. coming from the DCS SDK.</p>
<p>Observations are part of <code>Sense</code>s, of which Jester has several (eyes, ears, …).
As of now, most of them are <em>WIP</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local isAirborne = GetJester().awareness:GetObservation("airborne") or false
</code></pre>
<h2 id="interactions"><a class="header" href="#interactions">Interactions</a></h2>
<p>One key aspect of Jester is that he can interact with the cockpit by clicking
switches, buttons and turning knobs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the API offers two approaches.</p>
<h3 id="component-interactions"><a class="header" href="#component-interactions">Component Interactions</a></h3>
<p>The preferred way to interact with the cockpit is via the component system.</p>
<p>To allow interaction, a manipulator has to be registered at <code>F_4E_WSO_Cockpit.lua</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ChaffMode: OFF, SGL, MULT, PROG
self:AddManipulator(
  "Chaff Mode",
  {component_path = "/WSO Cockpit/WSO Left Console/AN_ALE-40 CCU/Chaff Mode Knob"}
)
</code></pre>
<p>After that, it can easily be interacted with, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">task:AddAction(SwitchAction:new("Chaff Mode", "MULT"))
-- or in short
task:Click("Chaff Mode", "MULT")
</code></pre>
<p>or reading its current value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local cockpit = GetJester():GetCockpit()
local chaff_mode = cockpit:GetManipulator("Chaff Mode"):GetState()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="raw-interactions"><a class="header" href="#raw-interactions">Raw Interactions</a></h3>
<p>If the desired switch does not support the component interface yet,
one can instead fall back on a raw interface that invokes DCS commands directly,
as if the player would have triggered a bind manually.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- sends value 1 via command WSO_EJECT_INSTANT to device EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM
ClickRaw(devices.EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM, device_commands.WSO_EJECT_INSTANT, 1)

-- sends the value corresponding to position 2 on a 7-position knob
ClickRawKnob(devices.HUD_AN_ASG_26, device_commands.HUD_SelectHUDMode, 2, 7)
</code></pre>
<p>See <code>devices.lua</code> for all available devices and likewise <code>command_defs.lua</code> for
the commands.</p>
<p>In general, Knobs and 2-pos switches use the range <code>[0, 1]</code> for values, while
3-pos switches often (but not always) use <code>[-1, +1]</code>. For 3-pos switches <code>-1</code> is
usually used to move a 3-pos switch down, <code>+1</code> to move it up - but some switches
have a different orientation. See <code>default.lua</code> and <code>clickabledata.lua</code> to learn
more about a specific switch and how it reacts to values.</p>
<h2 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h2>
<p>Next to clicking switches, Jester can react to events send either from C++ or
also from within Lua. The system follows a simple observer/listener pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo("go_silent", "Radar", function(task)
  task:Click("Radar Power", "STBY")
end)
</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">if is_aar then
  DispatchEvent("go_silent")
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="task-api"><a class="header" href="#task-api">Task API</a></h2>
<p>A core aspect of writing logic for Jester revolves around using the <code>Task</code> class.
Tasks consist of a sequence of <code>Action</code>s. A task can be paused, resumed or cancelled entirely by
the system if necessary.</p>
<p>Actions are, by design, executed asynchronously. Executing a click will take some time and
not execute instantly. In particular, adding a click action to a task will not block the code,
it simply gets added to the chain of actions to execute eventually.</p>
<p>This concept is similar to Future-APIs in other languages and <code>Task</code> offers a fluent-API to deal
with it conveniently.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local task = Task:new()
task:Roger()
  :Click("Radar Power", "OPER")
  :Wait(min(4))
  :Click("Screen Mode", "radar")
  :Say("phrases/radar_ready")
  :Then(function()
    self.scan_for_bandits = true
  end)
</code></pre>
<p>Among other functions, the API offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AddAction</code> - any <code>Action</code>, basis for the API</li>
<li><code>Then</code> - anonymous function</li>
<li><code>Wait</code> - time</li>
<li><code>WaitUntil</code> - predicate</li>
<li><code>Say</code> - phrase</li>
<li><code>Roger</code></li>
<li><code>CantDo</code></li>
<li><code>Click</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickFast</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickShort</code> - name, state</li>
<li><code>ClickShortFast</code> - name, state</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to <code>Task.lua</code> for details.</p>
<h2 id="ui"><a class="header" href="#ui">UI</a></h2>
<p>Jester provides two types of user interfaces. A wheel with selectable options
and a dialog with questions and selectable answers that are shown on demand. See
<a href="dcs/modding/jester/wheel_ui.html">Wheel UI</a> and <a href="dcs/modding/jester/dialog_ui.html">Dialog UI</a> for more.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wheel-ui"><a class="header" href="#wheel-ui">Wheel UI</a></h1>
<p>Jester Wheel consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua
for modifying its content and reacting to actions.</p>
<h2 id="frontend"><a class="header" href="#frontend">Frontend</a></h2>
<p>The frontend is a <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi JS</a> based website defined in</p>
<p><code>f-4e\ModFolders\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\UI\JesterWheel</code></p>
<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the wheel filled with the base content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS
(<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).</p>
<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the
interactions are handled in <code>main.js</code>.</p>
<p><code>interface.js</code> declares the base content of the wheel, as well as all methods
relevant for the C++ to JS communication.</p>
<p>The method <code>hb_send_proxy</code> is used to send commands to C++, such as notifying it
that an action has been clicked.</p>
<h2 id="lua"><a class="header" href="#lua">Lua</a></h2>
<p>The wheel is essentially a menu-tree. Each menu consists of up to 8 items. An
item might be final or contain another sub-menu. Additionally, a sub-menu can
also be spawned as outer-menu, which increases its item slots to 18.</p>
<p>Each item can be associated with an <code>action</code>, a string that is tied to the Event
System and can hence be reacted to if invoked.</p>
<p>To interact with the menu, several methods are defined and exported to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Wheel.ReplaceMainMenu(main_menu)
Wheel.ReplaceSubMenu(sub_menu, menu_location)
Wheel.AddItem(item, menu_location)
Wheel.RemoveItem(item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.ReplaceItem(item, item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.RenameItem(new_item_name, current_item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.SetMenuInfo(info_text, menu_location)
Wheel.NavigateTo(menu_location)
</code></pre>
<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new sub-menu to the <code>Navigation</code>
menu:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local waypoint_menu = Wheel.Item:new({
  name = "Select Waypoint",
  menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
    name = "Select Waypoint",
    items = {
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 1", action = "select_tgt_1" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 2", action = "select_tgt_2" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Advanced", outer_menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
        name = "More Waypoints",
        items = {
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "RTB", action = "select_rtb" }),
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Nearest Target", action = "select_tgt" }),
        },
      })}),
    }
  }),
})

Wheel.AddItem(waypoint_menu, {"Navigation"})
</code></pre>
<p>The info text of the menu can then be updated using</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local current_waypoint = "WP 2"
Wheel.SetMenuInfo(current_waypoint, {"Navigation", "Select Waypoint"})
</code></pre>
<p>To react to a selected action, listen to the corresponding event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo("select_tgt_1", "Navigation", function(task)
  -- Component interface
  task:Click("Nav Panel Function", "TARGET_1")

  -- or Raw interface
  task:Then(function()

      device_commands.RIO_NAV_COMP_FUNCTION_SELECTOR_KNOB,
      3,
      5
    ) -- Target 1

end)

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dialog-ui"><a class="header" href="#dialog-ui">Dialog UI</a></h1>
<p>Jester Dialog consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua

<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the dialog filled with example content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS

<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the

<h2 id="lua-1"><a class="header" href="#lua-1">Lua</a></h2>
<p>Dialogs are shown on-demand and in-order. They are displayed for a certain time
and the user is given a chance to engage in the dialog or ignore it - upon which
it will expire and vanish.</p>
<p>A dialog consists of a question with up to 4 selectable options. An option is
either final or triggers a follow-up question with new options to select from.</p>
<p>Dialogs are hold and shown from a queue. A new dialog can be pushed to the queue
via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Dialog.Push(dialog)

<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new dialog:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="liveries"><a class="header" href="#liveries">Liveries</a></h1>
<p><em>"We got them in two-tone gray. We got them in two-tone green.
We can get them in hot fuchsia pink."</em></p>
<p>Creating Liveries for our F-4E can be tedious work.</p>
<p>Typically, the largest chunk of time goes into researching on the web and in
books to provide the most accurate, realistic Liveries.</p>
<p>With the release of the F-4E Phantom II, we want to see what you have in store
for the F-4. To support you in your creative ways of recreating your favorite
Livery, there is a few things to learn regarding the jet and how it is
represented in DCS.</p>
<h2 id="paintkit"><a class="header" href="#paintkit">Paintkit</a></h2>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/../../img/dcs_liveries_template.jpg" alt="dcs_liveries_template" /></p>
<p>The Paintkit has been created with ease of use in mind. It allows unwrapping the
3D Object onto a 2D space.</p>
<p>To provide the highest quality available, the Paintkit comes in <strong>Linear Color
Space</strong> and <strong>16 Bit Color depth</strong>. Bear in mind that not every Graphics Suite
will handle this correctly. The Paintkit was created using Adobe Photoshop.
Saving in 16 Bit Color depth will take a while, so be patient when hitting
<em>Save</em> in your Graphics Application.</p>
<p>The kit also provides a layer stack <em>Administrative Tools</em>, which also contains
the <em>Wireframe unwrap</em> helping to aligning your art.</p>
<p>The folder called <em>Partsfinder</em> helps identify pieces that belong together on
the <em>UV Unwrap</em> for certain parts. There is no padding applied there, so if you
use them for your selection, you might want to expand your selection by a few
pixels to get rid of artifacts on the seams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 You can link files in Photoshop. This means you can create art, save it as
a file and then link it in your Paintkit file. This makes for a non
destructive workflow which allows you to changes things afterwards if you are
not satisfied with your result.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="pbr-rendering-and-roughmet-file"><a class="header" href="#pbr-rendering-and-roughmet-file">PBR Rendering and RoughMet File</a></h2>
<p>Next to your <em>Albedo File</em> which you create by exporting your custom Livery out
of the Paintkit, you will need the <em>RoughMet File</em> to make the most out of your
custom livery.</p>
<p>We provide you the uncompressed RoughMet files within the Paintkit files. DCS
uses <strong>Physical Based Rendering</strong> to create the picture you see on your monitor
or through your VR Headset.</p>
<p>The RoughMet files makes use of the three RGB Channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red -&gt; Ambient Occlusion (pre baked Shadows)</li>
<li>Blue -&gt; Metallic (Defines if a Surface is metallic or not)</li>
<li>Green -&gt; Roughness (is the Surface super smooth or really rough)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Roughmet File is in the <strong>8Bit RGB Range of Colors</strong>, per channel, you
get 255 Values to define the named attributes. Visually this is represented per
channel with a value of 0 for Black and a value of 255 for White.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/modding/../../img/dcs_liveries_material_error.jpg" alt="dcs_liveries_material_errors" /></p>
<h3 id="avoid-bright-or-dark-colors"><a class="header" href="#avoid-bright-or-dark-colors">Avoid bright or dark colors</a></h3>
<p>Together with what is defined in the RoughMet, the DCS engine renders the
picture. You must avoid using very bright or dark and 100% saturated Colors, as
otherwise that leads to DCS not being able to create proper effects when the
surface is hit by direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the engine can not render a color greater than the available
color space. So if you want a bright yellow marking on your jet, reduce the
saturation by around 15% as well as the brightness.</p>
<p>Ultimately you can check if your textures are withing the <strong>PBR Spectrum</strong> by
loading up your Custom Livery in the DCS <em>Modelviewer</em> and hit <kbd>F8</kbd>
which reveals the issue in the <strong>Material Errors View</strong>. If you see an orange or
magenta color here, it means that the Renderer cannot draw the full effects on
it since the base color (<strong>Albedo</strong>) is too bright or saturated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 There are many great sources out there to learn more about Physical Based
Rendering and you're always welcome to ask us directly in our

<h2 id="character-customization"><a class="header" href="#character-customization">Character Customization</a></h2>
<p>The Phantom features <a href="dcs/modding/../character.html#customization">Character Customization</a>.</p>
<p>Until the feature and its UI is fully available at a later point during Early
Access, some of its features can already be accessed directly by modifying the
<code>description.lua</code> file of your Livery.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the area you need to look at:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">custom_args =
{
  [512] = 0.3, -- 0 is no mirrors, 0 - 0.4 is both mirrors (mickey mouse) and 0.5+ is top mirror only.

  [2006] = 0.95, --Pilot Helmet, 0.95 is HGU-55 (expand list of draw args)
}

<p>Find the <code>custom_args</code> section which is usually towards the bottom of the file.
The numbers inside <code>[]</code> represents the <strong>Draw Argument</strong> used by DCS to tell the
model what your Pilot (and also the aircraft itself) wears.</p>
<p>Draw Argument <code>[512]</code> represents the <strong>Mirrors on the WSO Canopy</strong>. It can be
set to a value between 0.0 to 1.0, representing the animation range of the Draw
Argument.</p>
<p>This value is used to give your pilot a certain helmet, gloves or similar. Or
even to define the gender of the pilot model.</p>
<p><code>[2006]</code> is the Draw Argument for the Pilot Helmet. Set it to <code>0.1</code> and your
pilot will wear an old school HGU-2 helmet. Set it to <code>0.95</code> and he will be
wearing a more modern HGU-55.</p>
<h2 id="applying-custom-paints"><a class="header" href="#applying-custom-paints">Applying Custom Paints</a></h2>
<p>To apply a custom texture to the jet, copy an existing and replace the files
while keeping the names. You can find a small library of textures to cut down on
the overall size of a Livery in the <em>commons</em> folder under
<code>\CoreMods\aircraft\F-4E\Liveries\F-4E-45MC\commons</code>.</p>
<p>Trying to keep folder depth shallow this at first might look a bit messy but it
actually makes it easier to apply the texture in your <code>description.lua</code> and does
not bloat it too much with long folder paths.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h3>
<p>The Folder <em>ALQ131_g</em> contains a Livery for the ALQ-131 Pod in Olive/Green
colors. You can tell your <code>description.lua</code> to use this texture instead of the
default white color from DCS when equipping the ALQ-131 to the Phantom in-game
by putting the following line of code into your <code>description.lua</code> file for both
the Albedo and the Roughmet Texture:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">{ "ALQ_131", 0, "../commons/alq131_g/alq_131_diff", false };
{ "ALQ_131", ROUGHNESS_METALLIC, "../commons/alq131_g/alq_131_diff_roughmet", false };
</code></pre>
<p>The first value after the <code>{</code> in Brackets <code>""</code> is the Material Name, in this
case the <code>"ALQ_131"</code>. It can be a bit tricky to find these Material names
through DCS. Feel free to ask in our
<a href="https://discord.com/servers/heatblur-simulations-1071433028045377637">Discord</a>
in the <strong>#liveries-lair</strong> channel for help on this.</p>
<p>Using the same principle, you can apply custom Flight Suit textures to your
Pilot as well as a HGU-2 Texture. Here is an example of a German Luftwaffe F-4F
Pilot and the WSO being equipped with German Luftwaffe Flight Suits and Grey
HGU-2 Helmets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">{ "PILOT_HGU-2_Helmet", 0, "../commons/HGU2_g/HGU-2_Helmet", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_CWU", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_cwu", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_overall", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_overall", NORMAL_MAP,
  "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall_nrm", false };
{ "PILOT_HB_Char_RobinOlds_roughmet", ROUGHNESS_METALLIC,
  "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall_roughmet", false };

{ "WSO_HGU-2_Helmet", 0, "../commons/HGU2_g/HGU-2_Helmet", false };
{ "WSO_HB_Char_RobinOlds_CWU", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_cwu", false };
{ "WSO_HB_Char_RobinOlds_overall", 0, "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall", false };
{ "WSO_HB_Char_RobinOlds_overall", NORMAL_MAP,
  "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall_nrm", false };
{ "WSO_HB_Char_RobinOlds_roughmet", ROUGHNESS_METALLIC,
  "../commons/LGFS/hb_char_robinolds_overall_roughmet", false };
