<h2 id="condition-and-wear"><a class="header" href="#condition-and-wear">Condition and Wear</a></h2>
<p><em>"And I'll tell you what, since Cal's on it, it's only flown on approved
cross-countries and drill weekends. Mint condition, folks, no over-Gs."</em></p>
<p>All components of the aircraft simulate wear individually, yielding a unique
experience on each spawn, but also based on how the F-4 is flown.</p>
<p>It is generally differentiated between <strong>Condition</strong> and the <strong>Wear and Tear</strong>,
both are dynamic at spawn and can be influenced throughout a mission by various
factors such as forces, temperature and also combat damage.</p>
<p>The aircraft has thousands of components that are subject to this system. One
concrete example would be the speed of the Pave Spike Targeting Pod elevation
gimbal motor. Under perfect condition, it is supposed to have a speed of 60
degrees per second. However, a factory generally can not ensure this to always
be the case and accepts a variance, for example it must be within 1% error.</p>
<p>Mathematically, variance is simulated as <strong>normal distribution</strong>, consisting of
the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>μ (Mu, mean) - the value it would have under perfect condition</li>
<li>σ (Sigma) - the variance of the value</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/normal_distribution.jpg" alt="Normal Distribution" /></p>
<p>Around 70% of times the value will be within one unit of σ, in 95% of cases it
will be within 2 units of σ. Extreme cases above 3 units of σ are possible, but
very rare.</p>
<p>Said motor has for example a σ value of 3% around 60 degrees per second, meaning
that the vast majority of targeting pods will be produced with a motor capable
of moving the elevation gimbal between 58 and 62 degrees per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Variance goes in both directions, your Phantom can also be faster than it
is supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aircraft-condition"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-condition">Aircraft Condition</a></h3>
<p>An aircraft's condition generally refers to its factory and production quality.
For example, during war times a factory might run out of supplies and reduce
their acceptance criteria during production, generally increasing variance in
individual component performance.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Condition</strong>
slider, indicating quality from 0% (poor quality) to 100% (high quality).</p>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 0%, its speed variance σ
will increase from 3% to 8%, causing majority of pods to be produced with a
speed between 55 and 65 degrees per second instead.</p>
<p>Aircraft condition will always still be within limits that a manufacturer might
find reasonably acceptable. The aircraft is always still fully functional and
operational.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-wear-and-tear"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-wear-and-tear">Aircraft Wear and Tear</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to production quality, components can degrade during service based
on time since the last overhaul, external factors like temperature and weather,
aggressive flying involving a lot of forces on the airframe, as well as combat
damage.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Wear and Tear</strong>
slider, indicating wear from 0% (no wear) to 100% (a lot of wear), or even
beyond that. For an aircraft that was just repaired and came fresh out of
service, 0% is appropriate. 100% refers to the latest point at which an aircraft
would reasonably be send back for maintenance, as it starts being less effective
in practice. Values beyond, such as 500%, can be used to represent scenarios in
which pilots are forced to fly an aircraft that operates exceptionally below its
expected performance level. It is still somewhat usable, nothing is straight out
broken, but components just do not behave within acceptable parameters anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Values beyond 100% cannot be set in the Mission Editor, but are achievable
in-flight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 100% wear, its speed
variance σ will additionally increase by 20%. Assuming a good initial starting
condition, the motor will at that point likely operate between 45 and 75 degrees
per second.</p>
<p><img src="../img/broken_phantom_crash.jpg" alt="Crashed Phantom" /></p>
<h3 id="reference-aircraft"><a class="header" href="#reference-aircraft">Reference Aircraft</a></h3>
<p>The variance system at initial spawn can be turned off with this checkbox, if
desired. Components will then start with their mean value μ, without any
variance.</p>
<p>That is, with the option checked the setting for condition, as well as wear and
tear are ignored and disabled. The aircraft will spawn with all properties set
exactly as specified by the manufacturer and according to documentation, without
any variance.</p>
<p>This is especially interesting for competitions, where both sides should start
with the same conditions for fairness. Or when performing tests and computing
performance charts, where the aircraft should always start with the exact same
values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Even the reference aircraft is still subject to wear and tear during
flight. In a competition, if you pull high Gs, your aircraft's component
properties will deviate from your opponents.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ins-reference-alignment-stored"><a class="header" href="#ins-reference-alignment-stored">INS Reference Alignment Stored</a></h2>
<p>This checkbox allows significant reduction of the time needed for a proper INS
alignment during cold-start.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ground crew would previously have started the aircraft and
executed a full alignment, then shut it down again, while memorizing parts of
the alignment data.</p>
<p>See the <a href="../systems/nav_com/ins.html#heading-memory-alignment">INS section</a> for
details on how to execute a stored alignment.</p>

<p>Unchecked, any Jester mods will be ignored and the player automatically uses the
original Jester behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 This option is decoupled from DCS Integration Check (IC) system. That is,
you can for example enforce IC on your server, while at the same time allowing
users to mod their Jester.</p>

<p><img src="../img/me_radio_presets.jpg" alt="UHF Presets" /></p>
<p>It is possible to set up a station in the Mission Editor for use in ADF
navigation. To do this, a unit, such as a ground station, needs to be placed on
the map. This unit should then execute a command to tune into the desired AM
frequency (<em>Perform Command &gt; Set Frequency</em>). Finally, the unit must transmit a
message continuously throughout the mission, which requires setting the message
to loop (<em>Perform Command &gt; Transmit Message</em>).</p>
<p><img src="../img/me_adf.jpg" alt="ADF Station" /></p>
<p>Also, radio frequency parameters to read currently active UHF Radio frequencies
are provided for mission triggers:</p>

<h3 id="usage-of-setcommands"><a class="header" href="#usage-of-setcommands">Usage of SetCommands</a></h3>
<p>This chapter will explain the use of the different SetCommands that have more
complex values.</p>
<p><img src="../img/set_commands_me.jpg" alt="set_commands_me.jpg" /></p>
<h4 id="jester_tune_arc_164_channel"><a class="header" href="#jester_tune_arc_164_channel">Jester_tune_ARC_164_channel</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "0.XX," where "XX" is the two-digit channel number.</p>
<h4 id="jester_tune_tacan_channel"><a class="header" href="#jester_tune_tacan_channel">Jester_tune_TACAN_channel</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "s0.XXXY," where "s" is an optional minus sign. Use
negative values for A/A (Air-to-Air) and positive for T/R (Transmit/Receive).
"XXX" represents the three-digit channel number, with leading zeros required for
channels below 100. "Y" indicates the mode: "0" for X-mode and "1" for Y-mode.
For example, "0.0630" corresponds to channel 63X in T/R mode, while "-0.0081"
indicates channel 8Y in A/A mode.</p>
<h4 id="jester_deviate_to_tgt_zone"><a class="header" href="#jester_deviate_to_tgt_zone">Jester_deviate_to_tgt_zone</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "0.XX," where "XX" is the WaypointZone number. Note
that the trigger zone must be named "WaypointZone." For example, "0.02"
corresponds to "WaypointZone02."</p>
<h4 id="jester_add_wpt_after"><a class="header" href="#jester_add_wpt_after">Jester_add_wpt_after</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "0.TTXXY," where "TT" is the waypoint zone number,
"XX" is the waypoint number, and "Y" is the flight plan number.</p>
<h4 id="jester_resume_flightplan"><a class="header" href="#jester_resume_flightplan">Jester_resume_flightplan</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "0.XXY," where "XX" is the waypoint number (e.g.,
"01" for waypoint 1, "12" for waypoint 12), and "Y" is the flight plan number
(default is 1 if not specified). Examples include "0.05," which refers to turn
point 5 in flight plan 1, and "0.102," which refers to turn point 10 in flight
plan 2.</p>
<h4 id="jester_designate_wpt"><a class="header" href="#jester_designate_wpt">Jester_designate_wpt</a></h4>
<p>The value follows the format "0.DXXY," where "D" is the waypoint designation,
"XX" is the waypoint number (e.g., "01" for waypoint 1, "12" for waypoint 12),
and "Y" is the flight plan number (default is 1 if not specified). The waypoint
designations are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 -&gt; Default</li>
<li>1 -&gt; CAP</li>
<li>2 -&gt; IP</li>
<li>3 -&gt; Target</li>
<li>4 -&gt; VIP</li>
<li>5 -&gt; Silent VIP</li>
<li>6 -&gt; Fence IN</li>
<li>7 -&gt; Fence Out</li>
<li>8 -&gt; Homebase</li>
<li>9 -&gt; Alternate</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, "0.005" indicates turn point 5 in flight plan 1 with a Default
designation, while " 0.3102" represents turn point 10 in flight plan 2 with a
Target designation.</p>
<h4 id="jester_set_cap_time"><a class="header" href="#jester_set_cap_time">Jester_set_cap_time</a></h4>
<p>The value sets the CAP time for the active CAP pair in the format "0.XX," where
"XX" represents the number of minutes. For example, "0.05" corresponds to 5
minutes, and "0.12" corresponds to 12 minutes.</p>
<h4 id="wrcs-entries-and-laser-code"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-entries-and-laser-code">WRCS Entries and Laser Code</a></h4>
<p>The WRCS Entries are used from 0.999 to 0.000 where 0.999 is the biggest value
the WRCS can feature. For Jester_set_wrcs_ew_dist and Jester_set_wrcs_ns_dist
the s is for - . When a negative value is entered it will put in West or South
values respectively.</p>
<p>The laser code can be set by entering a valid laser code for XXXX. Note that
Jester will not enter invalid codes and will not respond in any way other than
not entering the laser code.</p>
