                        <h1 id="training-missions"><a class="header" href="#training-missions">Training Missions</a></h1>
<h2 id="lessons"><a class="header" href="#lessons">Lessons</a></h2>
<p>These missions, we like to call them "lessons", have been designed in such a way that, as a
beginner, everything important that you need for a successful start with your new F-4E Phantom II is
explained.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-goals"><a class="header" href="#lesson-goals">Lesson goals</a></h2>
<p>The stated goal of these lessons is that after completing them once or several times, you can
say: "Hey, I think I now know how this thing works (again)".
You can use the lessons as "initial training" or as so-called "recurrent training". Whenever
you haven't flown for a long time and need a refresher. By the way: We recommend a refresher
every 90 days at least.</p>
<p>Please note that the lessons require a certain level of knowledge about DCS and also some basic
flying skills. In the
lessons we don't explain flying as such, but rather the aircraft, its systems and their usage, and
the behavior. The lessons may therefore be understood as a kind of "interactive type training in the
cockpit" and not as a "basic flying training".</p>
<h2 id="your-way-through"><a class="header" href="#your-way-through">Your way through</a></h2>
<p>Due to the design, systems and age of the jet, it has many pecularities. Precise application of
system knowledge in daily duty on this wonderful aircraft is the key to success. With the F-4E
Phantom II you will be challenged in so many ways. So be ready! We leave it up to you whether you
want to get in the air immediately without studying the manual, or whether you want to read upon it
before your first flight.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself!</p>
<p>If you want to fly immediately, the training lessons will provide you with enough knowledge to
successfully complete these flights. You can even study this section or other parts of the manual
during your flights; this is another innovation in the DCS F-4E Phantom II. The lessons can be
paused at any time if necessary. Of course, you are welcome to practice multi-tasking and fly at the
same time as studying the manual; that's not explicitly forbidden! Learning by doing is the basic
strategy for the training lessons, but you will be required to read through the manual and carefully
study the systems if you want to become a real pro.</p>
<h2 id="procedures"><a class="header" href="#procedures">Procedures</a></h2>
<p>We have depicted the most important "normal procedures" of the aircraft and have based the lessons
very much on reality. These procedures should also be based as closely as possible on the real
procedures, although we were aware that it wouldn't be possible to implement everything in the
simulation. Think, for example, of the ejection seat harness, the oxygen mask and its test, the
transponder, the IFF system, or similar systems. Some steps are left out because they are already
set correctly after spawning the aircraft and to really speed up the lesson to get you in the air;
of course you may check them as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, not all procedures are depicted as can be found in real aircraft manuals; some of
them had to be changed, shortened, or omitted entirely. Nevertheless, for example, we
simulated putting on the helmet (including sun protection visor and sun glasses), an immersive
innovation in DCS.</p>
<h2 id="our-way-through"><a class="header" href="#our-way-through">Our way through</a></h2>
<p>We thought a lot about how best to explain the operation of such a complex aircraft with training
missions. Where do you start, where do you end? How detailed should it be so that a "nerd" doesn't
miss anything, how superficial can it be so that a "leisure gamer" doesn't lose interest? How tight
are the checks whether the player is adhering to the procedures and the planned flight route? A
basic idea at Heatblur has always been to get players "in the air" as quickly as possible, without
them having to spend hours watching introductory videos or studying thick books. All of this caused
us a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>In any case, we spared no expense, effort and discussions to serve both types of players more or
less "equally". As you can imagine, such a project is not entirely trivial, and you have to make a
lot of compromises when designing the lessons. Sometimes, you have to tell hardliners: "Hey, this
might be too difficult for the players and not really relevant to the simulation, eventhough it
would be extra cool!" You have to convince other team members to do things they personally don't
like: Hey, that's exactly what the players need, but a little different please!</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had professional help from SME's (real former Phantom pilots and weapons systems
officer and even instructors). These guys helped us with so many decisions, and spiced the product
with their knowledge and experience. Conversely, they slapped us on the wrist if we left out
something they thought was important.</p>
<p>In a complex development process that such a high-quality DCS module requires, there are many
obstacles and limitations, but also many opportunities and possibilities. That's why we made it a
point right from the start to present the handling of the aircraft's systems as comprehensively as
possible.</p>
<p>We hope you like what you have in hands now!</p>

<h2 id="general-tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#general-tips--tricks">General Tips &amp; Tricks</a></h2>
<p>It rarely happens that you get stuck in a procedure, or you don't know what to do
next.</p>
<p>Here are some general tips &amp; tricks as created by testers during the testing phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>For lessons starting on the ground, the noise might be very loud. You have three options:
<ul>
<li>Wait until the other jets have taken off before beginning with the lesson.</li>
<li>You are allowed to close the canopy whenever you need to (default binding is LCTRL+C), despite
the F-4 usually closes it very lately</li>
<li>Adjust the audio volume of DCS to suite the audio hardware you are using.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have troubles with a very dark cockpit, a few things can be done:
<ul>
<li>Use the internal cockpit illumination on the COCKPIT LIGHTS panel (right side):
<ul>
<li>The CONSOLE OFF/BRT knob</li>
<li>The INSTR PANEL knob</li>
<li>The CONSOLE FLOOD light switch</li>
<li>The INST FLOOD light switch</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/training_mission_cockpit_lights.jpg" alt="training_tips_illumination_pic" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Cockpit Global Illumination" to ON</li>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Gamma" to 2.0 or higher values.</li>
<li>Set the SYSTEM option "Shadows" off as the very last resort.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lesson-got-stuck"><a class="header" href="#lesson-got-stuck">Lesson got stuck</a></h2>
<p>There are situations in which the triggers of a lesson no longer work properly for some reason.
Fortunately, this only happens very rarely! This usually results in the highlights (the
yellow helper boxes) no longer being shown or hidden correctly, or the logic circuits no longer
reacting correctly to events in the simulation. We experienced this ourselves during the testing
phase from time to time, and we would like to at least inform you about here and now.</p>
<p>The influence of the time acceleration function on the stability of the lessons is not documented,
but to be on the safe side we advise against using the time acceleration function.</p>
<p>If you got stuck in a lesson, you should take the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay calm!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check whether everything in the aircraft is actually set up as required according to the
checklist/procedure. If necessary, check each of the previous steps individually and carefull,
starting from the top by asking yourself the following questions:
"What is written in the procedure/checklist/book?" and "How did I set it up?"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help:
Jump back one - or if necessary - a few steps (if that lesson supports jumping back via the comms
menu &gt; F-10 Other ...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that doesn't help either:
Jump back to the beginning of the procedure (if that lesson supports jumping back via the comms
menu &gt; F-10 Other ...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all that doesn't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quit the mission and save the DEBRIEFING (log-file) and the TRACK (trk-file) in the
debriefing screen</li>
<li>If you suspect a bug, please open a new ticker in the DCS forum &gt; Heatblur Simulations &gt;
Phantom area using this link: <a href="https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/">https://forum.dcs.world/forum/919-dcs-f-4-phantom/</a>. Please
add as much information as possible in order to help us finding a possible issue. Thank
you for your support!</li>
<li>In any case, we recommend to restart DCS and fly the mission again. Sorry for that!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="training-area-kobuleti-ug5x-airfield"><a class="header" href="#training-area-kobuleti-ug5x-airfield">Training area: Kobuleti (UG5X) airfield</a></h2>
<p>The entire F-4E Phantom II training will be held in Kobuleti in Georgia.
The choice fell on an airfield in the Caucasus region for understandable reasons, as this map is
delivered with DCS as standard. The training areas in the south of Georgia (designated
as "Training Area W" and "Training Area E") offer a sufficiently large playground for training,
including supersonic flights.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Georgia_Training_Area.jpg" alt="training_area" /></p>
<p>The airfield has a picturesque location between the mountains to the south and the Black Sea
to the west. Here is a photo of the airfield, taken a month ago from a helicopter, looking in
direction S-W.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Kobuleti_Airfield.jpg" alt="kobuleti_airfield" /></p>
<h2 id="lesson-01a---pilot-startup"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---pilot-startup">Lesson 01a - (PILOT) Startup</a></h2>
<h3 id="lesson-01a---weather"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---weather">Lesson 01a - Weather</a></h3>
<p>The weather has been bad in the last few days. A persistent Black Sea depression had brought a
lot of rain. However, stabilization occurred last night because dry air mass flows in from the
east. The mid-level cloud layer is expected to break up. The weather forecast predicts that the
clouds will no longer be a problem in about an hour and the temperature will rise quickly due to
strong sunshine. However, ground-level haze is still to be expected as the ground has stored a lot
of moisture and heavy evaporation from the sun is to be expected.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01_Kobuleti_WX.jpg" alt="lesson01b_weather_kobuleti" /></p>
<h3 id="lesson-01a---slots"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---slots">Lesson 01a - Slots</a></h3>
<p>Your fellow pilots will begin their flights immediately, your flight a little later. The airfield is
a very noisy environment, so wait until the jets positioned on the runway have taken off
before beginning with your lesson. Then the noise level should be somewhat tolerable ... hopefully.</p>
<p>Currently registered sorties for this afternoon:</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 Dodge 41 (AI, already in the air)</li>
<li>#2 Dodge 31 (AI, already in the air)</li>
<li>#3 Dodge 21 &amp; 22 (AI, at the start)</li>
<li>#4 Dodge 11 (you, at parking position #25)</li>
</ul>
<p>All Dodge flights complete familiarization and training flights at the airfield.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-01a---aircraft"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---aircraft">Lesson 01a - Aircraft</a></h3>
<p>Your aircraft is "cold &amp; dark" on the ramp #25, the nose is pointed towards the runway, and is
prepared and fully fueled. The Dash-60 ground power unit is already in place left of your jet.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01_Slot_Ramp_no25.jpg" alt="lesson01a_hangar_view" /></p>
<p>The technician responsible for the aircraft, also called the "crew chief", is already in front of
your aircraft and waiting to support you. You can communicate with him using the Jester menu &gt; CREW
CHIEF. Don' confuse the "crew chief" with Jester. Sometimes they sound very similar when heard
over the intercom, but in fact you are dealing with two different persons!</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01_Crew_chief_Ramp_no25.jpg" alt="lesson01a_crew_chief" /></p>
<p>By the way, the crew chief's assistant is standing by on your left side, next to the Dash-60 ground
power
unit. He is operating the unit, and everything you request is in fact done by him, while the crew
chief
is directing, monitoring and the person in charge.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01_Crew_chief_assistant_Ramp_no25.jpg" alt="lesson01a_crew_chief_assistant" /></p>
<p>You've just sat down on the ejection seat and are starting to check the cockpit. You may be
thinking:
"Damn, I'm totally blown away by what I see, but I guess I don't know what I'm doing ...".</p>
<p>Don't worry, your instructor, who is also your WSO for today's flight, will guide you through
the lesson!</p>
<h3 id="lesson-01a---audio--text"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---audio--text">Lesson 01a - Audio &amp; text</a></h3>
<p>Your instructor speaks from the back seat, always listen carefully. Assume that everything he says
is important. As an aid, all of the text he speaks is displayed at the top right of the screen. If
you don't notice or understand something, you can always read it above. The text remains visible on
the screen for a maximum of 1000 seconds until it either disappears or is replaced by new text.</p>

<p>The lessons are divided into tasks, which are based on the names of the procedures. These
tasks are divided into individual steps, whereby the steps go hand in hand with the individual
items in the procedure.
The tasks for this lesson are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1: Check the aircraft and essential switches before applying external power.</li>
<li>Task 2: Perform the "Internal inspection" of the aircraft.</li>
<li>Task 3: Prepare the aircraft for engine start.</li>
<li>Task 4: Start the engines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lesson-01a---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-01a---tips--tricks">Lesson 01a - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 01a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task 4:
Let the instructor speak to the end of each instruction, there is enough time for the
actions to be carried out.</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step 4b:
Be careful when opening the fuel, this should not be done before 10% RPM! If you see the
EGT rising above 700°C, immediately cut off the fuel by moving the throttle lever to the
"OFF" position. Note: engine parameters may vary slightly depending on the environmental
conditions, but only the EGT value must be monitored closely!</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step 4c:
Make sure you pull the throttle lever in the simulation back to "IDLE" position in order for
the lesson logic to continue. The background is the following: Users reported about problems
when performing this step. In all cases reported so far, the real throttle lever was pulled
back to (its) IDLE position, but the throttle lever in the simulation did not reach the
"IDLE" position, but became stuck a bit too far forward.
Therefore, please make sure that your real throttle levers are able to move the throttle levers
in the sim over the whole range:
<ul>
<li>"MAX" (which is 100% RPM with full afterburner)</li>
<li>"MIL" (which is 100% RPM without afterburner)</li>
<li>"IDLE" (which is 65% RPM)</li>
<li>"OFF" (which is fuel shut off)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Task 4 &gt; Step "STARTING ENGINES PROCEDURE" checklist:
Make sure all controls are still set to their commanded positions, which have been set in all the
other procedures before. Users reported problems about advancing, because they accidentally set
some controls to unexpected/false positions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The weather has been bad in the last few days. A persistent Black Sea depression had brought a
lot of rain. However, stabilization occurred last night because dry air mass flows in from the
east. The mid-level cloud layer is expected to break up. The weather forecast predicts that the
clouds will no longer be a problem in about an hour and the temperature will rise quickly due to
strong sunshine. However, ground-level haze is still to be expected as the ground has stored a lot
of moisture and heavy evaporation from the sun is to be expected.</p>

<p>Caused by an accident on the taxiway "S" just before your flight, it was decided to close the
taxiway.
Therefore, a new temporary ramp position, which is located directly on the
threshold runway 07, was established. You will take off from that location and then divert to
Vaziani.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01b_temporary_ramp_position.jpg" alt="lesson_01b_temporary_ramp_rwy07" /></p>
<p>All remaining sorties for this afternoon will take-off from there.</p>

The Dash-60 ground power unit is already in place left of your jet.</p>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson01b_jet_at_temporary_ramp_position.jpg" alt="lesson_01b_ramp" /></p>
<p>The technician responsible for the aircraft, also called the "crew chief", is already waiting

<p><img src="../img/Lesson01b_crew_chief_at_temporary_ramp_position.jpg" alt="lesson_01b_crew_chief" /></p>
<p>By the way, the crew chief's assistant is standing by on your left side, next to the Dash-60 ground
power unit. He is operating the unit, and everything the pilot request is in fact done by him,
while the crew chief is directing, monitoring and the person in charge.</p>

<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 02:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7:
The flight controls check can be omitted in case it becomes too difficult. Use the FIRE
TEST BUTTON on the instrument panel before or during performing this check to skip it. The
reason for this is that for this check a few things have to be done in parallel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to our instructor</li>
<li>Performing the inputs on the flight control system (movements and button/switch
presses/settings)</li>
<li>Listening to the confirmation given by the crew chief</li>
<li>Pressing "Spacebar" after receiving the crew chief's confirmation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 7f &amp; 7h: The crew chief will not respond when you set the rudder to the neutral
position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Introduction:
Observe that the audio containing the taxi clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signal to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1a)
Use the power levers very gently! Once the aircraft started rolling, pull back the power
levers to idle and carefully control the taxi speed using minimum power together with
the wheel brakes.</p>

<h3 id="lesson-03---tips--tricks"><a class="header" href="#lesson-03---tips--tricks">Lesson 03 - Tips &amp; tricks</a></h3>
<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 03:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Steps 4a - 4e:
The flight controls check only requires to check if the stick is moving freely (at least 50%
of the stick deflection must be made). You can also check the rudder, but this is not
required by that step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 1 &gt; Step 10:
Having the MASTER CAUTION alert active indicates something is or at least was wrong. So
reset it, then check if it stays out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 2 &gt; Step 1:
Observe that the audio containing the line-up clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Introduction
Observe that the audio containing the take-off clearance by ATC is played through your UHF
radio. Therefore, if you turn off or tune down the volume of the radio, or route the audio
signals to some other audio device tuned down in volume, you might not hear the call
correctly. In any way, the spoken text can be read on the upper right corner of the screen,
and the lesson continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 5:
For beginners, we recommend to perform the first take-off without afterburner (just MIL
power, which means 100% rpm without afterburner), despite we know that taking off with
afterburner is a ton of fun. The reason behind is, that you will then be able to hear all
call-outs of your instructor, because the time needed for the take-off is long enough.
Whenever you think you manage all steps by heart that are necessary for a safe take-off
without any instructions, go for a take-off with afterburner. Please don't tell our SME's
that this text exists at all, and never tell someone that you have followed the
recommendation ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take-off:
Before taking off, go through the takeoff procedure. You need to remember the items by heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>No NGS after 70 knots</li>
<li>Full aft STICK by 80 knots</li>
<li>Hold 10 to 12° NOSE UP</li>
<li>Raise the GEAR &amp; FLAPS as soon as airborne</li>
<li>TRIM as needed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 8:
In DCS, with the current wind situation (no cross wind component), it is really not
necessary to use the nose gear steering. You will only be reminded by the instructor in case
you use the nose gear steering above 70 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Step 11:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid over-
trimming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 4 &gt; Steps 13:
Make sure to have flaps retracted before reaching 250 knots, but there is a certain safety
buffer and they should not be damaged at exactly 250 knots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 5 &gt; Step 1:
Make sure to fly a heading of about 064° and climb after lift-off.
Make sure to fly at an airspeed of not more than 350 knots.
Fly a shallow climb when using no afterburner (about 10° pitch angle).
Fly a steep climb when using afterburner (about 30° pitch angle).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reaching a certain altitude and airspeed with gear and flaps up, the lesson is
accomplished. You may continue the climb following the route which is commanded by your
instructor. If you got "lost in space", open up the F-10 map, click on your aircraft, and
observe the planned flightroute; you may then follow it more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task 6 &gt; Step 1d:
There is currently no way of comparing the values on both altimeters. This step was kept in
the procedure just in case you need it when operating with a real WSO in the rear seat.</p>

<p>Here are some special tips for lesson 04:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim the jet:
Pitch trim is best done in a number of quick pulses instead of one long press to avoid
over-trimming.</li>
<li>Autopilot:
Use the autopilot modes "attitude hold" and "altitude hold" whenever you think you need your hands
free. The system is a great assistant, so use it!</li>
<li>DME distances:
DME distance information is shown on the lower left corner of the HSI.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson04_HSI_DME.jpg" alt="lesson04_dme_distance" /></p>
<ul>
<li>HSI course settings:
The course setting can be changed with the COURSE SET KNOB on the lower right corner of the HSI:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson04_HSI_HDG.jpg" alt="lesson04_hsi_course" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 4:
If you can't reach the COMM Antenna Select Switch, move the throttles back for a moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../img/Lesson04_COMM_Antenna_switch.jpg" alt="lesson04_comm_antenna" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Task 1 &gt; Step 8:
The transition altitude in this particular region is 4,000m (13,120 ft), and the transition level
is
flight level 140 (FL140, which is 14,000 feet). When you descend through 14,000 feet, you have to
set your altimeter to the value of the local QNH (which today is 29.84 in/HG). It's no big deal if
you forget about that, it is not relevant for the outcome of the lesson.</li>
<li>PENETRATION / DESCENT:
Follow the instructions as good as possible. You may engage the attitude hold autopilot during
descent and focus on airspeed and power management. Don't forget to set the QNH once passing the
transition level (in this case 14,000 feet).</li>
<li>PENETRATION / TURN:
Fly a shallow left turn. If you have already reached 2,500 feet altitude, good. If you are still
higher, continue descending during the left turn until reaching 2500 feet. Keep an eye on your
sink
rate. Fly smoothly, and don't work hard on the stick. Intercept radial 064 as good as you can in
order to align on the runway heading. Treat her like a lady, and think ahead! Use the F-10 map if
you got lost in space. Don't rush into Batumi airspace.
Landing permission is already given. You are the last flight approaching the airfield for the next
two hours.</li>
<li>Task 2:
Remember these five items by heart: GEAR / FLAPS / HYDRAULIC PRESSURE / WARNING LIGHTS / ANTI SKID</li>
<li>Task 3:
If you fly correct airspeeds, all instructions can be heard until the end. If you rush, the
timeline
becomes compressed and the sequence of events then may become overwhelming.
During the approach continuously cross check Pitch / Power / Trim. Look out for the runway, adjust
your heading with slight roll maneuvers if necessary. Rise the seat in case you have troubles
seeing
the runway at higher angles of attack. Fly gently, follow the instructions, and think ahead!</li>
<li>Go-around:
In case you have the slightest doubt that you cannot manage a safe landing: GO AROUND. Fly the
missed approach procedure by entering a short left hand traffic pattern at 1500 feet at 250 knots.
Take your time, be patient with yourself, don't rush and keep an eye on airspeed and altitude!</li>
<li>Landing / flare:
The aircraft was certified for carrier landings. If you don't flare before touchdown at a 2°
to 3° approach path, you WILL slam the aircraft into the runway. This causes wear to the wheels
and the landing gear legs, but nothing more. You may decide on your own if you want to flare just
a bit to decrease the sink rate slightly. Sink rates above 3 to 4 m/s (600 to 700 ft/min)
depending on weight, might damage the landing gear though.</li>
<li>Landing / touchdown:
Make sure to stay aligned with the centerline using rudder only. Prepare yourself to deploy the
drag chute, which stabilizes the aircraft during the landing roll. Taxi to the end of the runway
and then leave it to the right side!</li>
<li>Taxi:
Follow the marshaller after leaving the runway. If you struggle performing the "After landing
procedure " while taxiing, you may stop the aircraft on the taxi way for that. The car though
will not stop. When finished with the procedure, continue taxiing to your initial parking
position, nose pointed towards shelter "25", and stop there.</li>
