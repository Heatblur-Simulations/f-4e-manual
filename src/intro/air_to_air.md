# F-4E Air to Air Kills

The F-4E Phantom II, an upgraded version of the F-4 Phantom series, played a
significant role in air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War. Equipped with the
AIM-7 Sparrow missile, a radar-guided weapon with beyond-visual-range
capabilities, the F-4E had a notable advantage in engagements.

In Vietnam, F-4E pilots engaged in dogfights against various enemy aircraft. The
Sparrow missiles allowed them to target adversaries from a distance, contributing
to the aircraft's success. Key USAF pilots, such as Steve Ritchie and Chuck
DeBellevue, achieved ace status by securing five or more air-to-air victories.

The total number of air-to-air kills attributed to the F-4E Phantom II,
combining both the USAF and USN, is estimated to be around 21 during the Vietnam
War, including 4 MiG-19s and 17 MiG-21s. However, this figure may vary across
sources. In total, F-4C/D/E Variants shot down 107 MiG jets, earning it the
nickname _"Biggest distributor of MiG parts"_.

Despite its effectiveness, the F-4E faced challenges in close-quarters combat
due to the initial absence of an internal cannon. Modifications, including the
addition of an M61 Vulcan cannon, addressed this limitation and improved the
aircraft's performance in close-range engagements.

The success of the F-4E Phantom II in Vietnam solidified its reputation as a
versatile and formidable fighter, and it continued to serve in the air forces
worldwide for many years.
