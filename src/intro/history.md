## F3H to AH-1, F-110 to F-4: A Navy Interceptor with Multi-role Pedigree

_(Mockup of the F-4 with AIM-7 Missiles)_

The developmental onset of the F-4 Phantom II began in the aftermath of
McDonnell's loss in the US Navy's 1953 Day Fighter Competition- the victor of
which was the Vought F8U. Choosing not to rest on failure, McDonnell
representatives canvased the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, a number of operational
commands, the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and any pilot or
maintainer willing to discuss the state of current naval aviation. After nearly
a year of analysis and design work - including a full scale mockup, the design of
what they would classify as a general fighter took shape. The potential of a
general fighter aircraft, rather than the specialized focus preferred by the
Navy at the time, was rooted in the success of the F3H-1 Demon
in threading of that very needle;
the Demon had been built as design in opposition of the F4D Skyray in the
interceptor role. As the Skyray proved its supersonic superiority during the
development cycle, McDonnell expanded the F3H Demon's capabilities to include
respectable air to ground armament to justify its place in the limited carrier
compliment when compared to the F10F Jaguar and F7U Cutlass, which were also
undergoing development at the time. Ultimately outfitted with the AIM-9
Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow - the latter giving the F3H a beyond visual range
capability the Skyray could never boast, and topping out with the ability to
carry and deliver 6,000 lbs of air to ground ordnance, the Demon out-measured
its competitors in combat potential, even when it came in second on paper for
raw performance.

Beginning with the intention to grow out the Demon as the baseline airframe, a
set of engineering evaluations were performed including both single and twin
engine configurations with different wings. The two most promising data sets-
twin-engine builds of the type designated the F3H-G and F3H-H- powered the
General Electric J65 and J79 respectively, replaced the original Demon wing with
a 45 degree swept wing. Particular focus was paid towards making the new
aircraft multi-mission capable, running a wide gamut of potential operations:
day or all-weather attack, photo recon, day or all-weather interception with a
Sparrow-compatible radar, electronic warfare, and a two seat strike coordination
configuration. Experimentation with this wide-ranging design intent went so far
as to include a novel interchangeable nose and cockpit arrangement, allowing
airframes to be reconfigured within a matter of hours for a given mission set
with the necessary systems fit for the crew.

While the Navy showed little interest in the nose replacement capability, the
bottom line numbers from the F3H-G and -H investigations got their attention: on
paper, they were capable of Mach 1.52, and an eye-watering Mach 1.97 at 35,000',
respectively. By October of 1954, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) had
evaluated similar unsolicited proposals from Grumman, Douglas, and North
American, and provided McDonnell with a $38 million dollar contract for two
flying examples of the Demon follow on- internally designated as the AH-1.

Two months later, the Navy threw McDonnell a curveball, directing the type to
be stripped of the air to ground fitment, and focusing on the all-weather
interceptor role in a single seat configuration, with the finalization for this
change in role being formally announced in April of 1955. The changeover was, in
some quarters, considered catastrophic- over time forcing the removal of the
planned internal gun, and stripping all of the hard-points, save for the
recessed Sparrow fuselage wells and a centerline tank position. At this point,
the determination of the J79 as the power plant was finalized with the Navy's
desire for a Mach 2 interceptor. Further, the determination of a two-man crew as
also put in place by the Navy - like McDonnell's own research, success in the
faster, longer ranged interception environment showed the utility of a second
man to handle the scope.

However, it wasn't a done deal. BuAero had been keeping conversation with Vought
at the same time, and in mid-1955 detailed a fly-off between the two competing
firms for the new interceptor role; this time pitting McDonnell's AH-1 contender
with an outgrowth of the already in-service Crusader: the F8U-3. Redesignated
the F4H in the intervening two and a half years leading into the late 1958
fly-off, McDonnell's Phantom II would trade substantial blows with Vought's
Crusader III during the Navy Preliminary Evaluation. Whereas McDonnell's design
entered the flight testing phase a month prior (and nominally entered
engineering almost a year ahead of Vought's entry), the benefits of Vought
carrying over much of the prior Crusader's aerodynamic profile appeared early in
the comparison, as the Crusader III was first to Mach 2 in flight testing, shown
capable of reaching higher top speeds during the Navy preliminary evaluation (NPE),
and noted for having more refined airframe handling in most regimes.

But as the Evaluation continued, it was found that McDonnell's Phantom II
countered the Crusader III where it mattered: in combat capability. The Navy
wanted a Mach 2 interceptor, not an overgrown daylight fighter. The F8U-3's
integration of the Sparrow was found lacking versus that of the Phantom, having
surrendered an AIM-7 against the F4H due to aerodynamic performance concerns. Of
even greater concern for the interceptor role- as McDonnell had previously found
internally, the pilot overhead to manage the AN/APG-74 radar installation in the
Crusader III while in combat was found to be too high to maintain effectiveness,
whereas the back-seater in the Phantom II could reliably acquire situational
awareness on the radar and maintain track locks for engagement while
maneuvering. McDonnell's F4H, while having more raw flying qualities, could
fight as the Navy needed it to. Further, as the firm had continued developing
its air to ground potential at the request of the Navy, even as they repeatedly
altered the program goals- the Phantom II, like the Demon before it, justified
its existence in the carrier compliment in all fights, not just the long range
interception role. And so on December 17th, 1958, the Navy Preliminary
Evaluation board announced its findings and the winner of the fly-off:
McDonnell's Phantom II.

The US Air Force was not oblivious to the Phantom II's development, as the Navy
having asked for the air to ground capability be revisited gave McDonnell a
point of entry. While the Air Force entertained McDonnell representatives in
discussion about a new ground attack airframe, the service actually had interest
in the Sparrow-dealing F4H as a replacement for the F-106. The Air Defense
Command requested an evaluation in 1961 known as Project High Speed, which once
again proved the Phantom II superior to a challenger in the interceptor role. In
light of the findings, Navy offered a bombing demonstration for Air Force
representatives of the Tactical Air Command, making special note of the
successful air to ground trials with the Phantom's multiple ejector racks- a
capability the USAF lacked. With Air Force policymakers, members of Congress,
and even Gen. Curtis LeMay in attendance during this demonstration series - with
a VX-5 F4H-1 accurately delivering twenty-two 500 lb bombs in spectacular
fashion, the stage was set for a Navy/McDonnell tactical aviation coup.

The inauguration of the Kennedy administration in January 1961 didn't hurt
matters; Kennedy brought in former Ford Motor Company president Robert McNamara
as Secretary of Defense. With an eye for optimization- sometimes to a fault, the
performance of McDonnell's F4H was seen as a standout to capitalize upon in
light of the administration's new conventional doctrine of "Flexible Response";
no longer would nuclear deterrence be the primary backstop of the US' promise to
NATO. While McNamara desired for the Navy's A-7 and the Air Force's F-111 to
fulfill tactical bombing roles for both services, the two airframes were at
least five years out to operational capability; the Phantom existed, provided
outstanding performance immediately, and could quickly raise the desired 50%
increase in conventional force structure the White House expected for the Air
Force. Pressure from all sides - the White House, Congress, McDonnell, and
foreign interest, ultimately defeated the USAF's resistance to an airframe "not
made here", and by January 1962 the USAF's budget had Phantoms on order the
Tactical Air Command; the Air Defense Command, which had started the Air Force's
investigation into the Phantom, would be left with the F-106.

Designated for a time as the F-110 to fit in with the Air Force's Century Series
as a matter of service pride, McDonnell's Air Force Phantom went into motion. An
initial delivery of Navy-configured F4Hs were provided for training and
evaluation later that year, with the first flight of a true F-4C taking place on
May 27th, 1963- the universal service designation system converting the F4H-1 to
the F-4B in September of 1962. Reconfiguration of the Phantom II for the USAF
was expedient, with the focus being on service-compliant alterations; these
included altering of the landing gear system for higher speed field operations,
the addition of dual flight controls, an anti-skid implementation, and
conversion to boom refueling compatibility. Further changes included the
addition of the LN-12 inertial navigation system, conversion to the APQ-100
radar with air to ground specific functionality, and a cartridge starting system
for field use without a compressed air cart in combination with an internal
battery. This F-4C configuration would be the first Phantom used during the
USAF's involvement in Vietnam, beginning in December of 1964.

## Backtracking with Haste - Correcting the USAF's Early F-4 Experience in Vietnam

![F-4_dropping_over_Vietnam](../img/F-4B_VF-111_dropping_bombs_on_Vietnam.jpg)

The Phantom's initial deployments to Southeast Asia delivered a number of
firsts - the first officially confirmed MiG-17 kill with the AIM-9 Sidewinder (on
July 10th, 1965), and the first US air-to-air shootdown of a MiG-21 (April 26th,
1966). Unfortunately, the Phantom was also the victim of the first US loss to a
SAM in Vietnam (July 24th, 1965), and the first US air-to-air loss from a MiG-21
(October 5th, 1966). With the initial teething problems of the type out of the
way - including alterations to the wing fuel cells and internal wiring, the
Phantom was found to be a capable, reliable airframe for the Air Force. Even the
missing gun had been worked around to some degree, with the integration of the
SUU-16 and SUU-23 external cannon pods. The in-production upgrade to the Air
Force's first Phantom - the F-4D, would include a multitude of quality of life
improvements: the APQ-109 radar with air to ground modes, the ASN-63 internal
navigation system, the ASQ-92 release computer. Further additions would include
automatic fuel transfer and a new sight, the ASG-22. Combat survivability would
be reinforced with the APS-107 RHAW and ECM pod compatibility, along with new
ejection seats. Yet, the service's desire to put its own "made here" flourish on
the type continued, inauspiciously culminating in the integration of the AIM-4
Falcon with the F-4D model.

Used on the F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart, and considered by some to
be a reasonable competitor to the AIM-9 Sidewinder, Air Force leadership
believed the AIM-4 could be installed in replacement of the Navy's short range
round with no loss of capability; this was quickly found to be a mistaken
premise. While the AIM-9B had limited maneuvering restrictions for launch and
acquisition like other short range infrared missiles of its generation, it was
substantially more reliable in use; the Falcon's cooling implementation could
only maintain the required seeker temperature for a short time once activated,
and could not be turned back on once the cooler timed out, while the un-cooled
9B could remain available indefinitely. Sidewinder acquired far more rapidly - in
many instances in less than two seconds, versus the six to seven seconds
required for the Falcon. Worse still, the AIM-4 was a hittile- its fin-contact
triggered fuzing required direct target impact for the missile's warhead to
detonate, whereas the AIM-9 carried a proximity fuze; any Sidewinder that got
close to its target was a threat to kill.

![f4_over_vietnam](../img/F-4Ds_435th_TFS_over_Vietnam.jpg)
_(F4-D of the 435th TFS over Vietnam)_

With initial F-4D deliveries to the 8th TFW in May of 1967, the performance of
the new configuration was quickly met with derision. The employment envelope was
too small compared to the Sidewinder, the lead time too long, and the weapon far
too unreliable to put into practice in the dynamic maneuvering environment of
air combat as it was waged in Southeast Asia. The failure of the Falcon to
succeed not only served to reaffirm the quality of the Sidewinder in comparison-
and also highlight the need for the service to upgrade the round as the Navy was
doing, but reinforced the concern held by aircrews about the lack of an internal
gun. SUU installations by this point had scored multiple victories over North
Vietnamese MiGs (ultimately ending the war with 9 confirmed kills), and it was
decided to rectify what many had considered the Phantom's original sin with
further revision to the F-4.

By the point McDonnell laid down the program update plan for the F-4E, the jet
was intended to carry with it the APQ-120 CORDS (Coherent On Receive Doppler
System) radar. With the directive to install an M61 internally, the radar would
receive changes to its mount, additional dampening, and alteration to its
antenna to fit in the reduced profile fuselage cavity directly above the cannon
barrel assembly. Hardware deleted for Sidewinder compatibility in the F-4D was
updated and returned. The ASG-26A Lead Computing Optical Sighting System was
installed along with updated aircrew in-range and shoot warning cues, solving
yet another lingering issue with the original F-4 specification; much has been
said and written regarding the lack of the gun in the Phantom and the lack of
training with respect to its performance over Vietnam - in the same respect, the
lack of effective cueing for the pilot and WSO as to their orientation and range
to target degraded many a shot opportunity. The updates to the Echo Phantom
would not stop there; compatibility with multi-ejection racks and updates to the
Weapon Release Computer to match provided further bombing capabilities. Further
changes over its service included provision for "soft wing" leading edge slats,
the AGM-65 Maverick, and the Digital Scan Converter Group interface for the
APQ-120.

Also of note was Rivet Haste - a late Vietnam training initiative heavily
influenced by two midlife updates- modification "556" and TISEO. Prior to
"556", weapons mode changes required the pilot to go hands off the throttle and
look down to the release panel, cycling a number of switches to disarm various
pylons and arm others; in the event of a lucky North Vietnamese bounce, or the
need to swap between weapons on the fly - looking away from the threat was time-consuming
and dangerous. With the modification, a pair of override switches were
added to the outboard throttle grip. The first, the "pinky" switch, placed
control of the gun, Sidewinder, and Sparrow in one of three positions, while the
second, on the forward face of the grip, switched weapons modes immediately
between air-to-air and air to ground; the pilot would now have immediate access
to his air-to-air weapons, and could swap them on the fly - never once looking
down in the cockpit. 556 also included modifications to the armament panel for
air to ground munitions, adding ripple release capability while reducing the
number of controls required to access full ARBCS programming.

Further reinforcement of crew initiative was the installation of TISEO - the Target
Identification System Electro-Optical. Consisting of a 4x/10x camera installed
in the left wing, TISEO provided visual identification of distant, radar-locked
targets, enabling the AIM-7 Sparrow to be used to its full extent. Coupled with
the Rivet Haste training - which put experienced aircrews through a program to
codify them as systems and tactics instructors (not unlike the NFWS education
being given to USN crews at the same time), the students championed the
modification program of the Phantom, and pushed for Double Attack (a parallel
development of Loose Deuce as had been used by the Navy in Vietnam since the
resumption of the bombing campaign) to become the standard for air-to-air
methodology across the Air Force. While this training was ultimately too late to
have real effect, with the final halt on US bombing coming just weeks after the
first Haste student crews returned to Vietnam, they would set the tone for USAF
Phantom crews going forward.

### The Transition from F-4D to F-4E

The F-4E that is implemented in the game is another upgrade from the F-4D for the US Air Force and
several other countries. It featured an integrated M61 Vulcan gun elongated in the Nose as well as
an AN/APQ-120 Radar with a reduced size to fit in with the new internally mounted M61 Vulcan. Other
upgrades included the J79-GE-17 engines with 17,900 lbf of afterburner thrust for each engine,
leading-edge flaps and slats to improve the maneuverability especially at high angle of attack. The
F-4E Phantom II was the most numerous version that has been built totalling at 1370 units. The F-4E
Phantom II is still in service at some operators across NATO including the Hellenic Air Force, the
South Korean Air Force and the Turkish Air Force. They are expected to fly at least until 2030.
