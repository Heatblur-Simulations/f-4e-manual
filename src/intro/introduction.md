# Introduction

Dear Reader,

we are proud to present to you the **Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II** for
Digital Combat Simulator. We’ve spent years of development and countless hours
of research to bring you the most in-depth recreation of this legendary aircraft
ever made. You will be able to fly your Phantom both as a pilot and WSO, alone
with the **JESTER-AI** - your own WSO AI - or in multiplayer together with a friend.

But not only did we recreate the Phantom’s flight model, systems, avionics,
radar, RWR and weapons delivery faithfully, we also tried to innovate our
approach to flight simulation in general with the module, laying important
groundwork for our future modules and as always trying to push the boundaries of
flight simulation just a little bit further. From small **quality of life
improvements** like being able to write on your canopy, to an **interactive crew
chief**, our Phantom also utilizes our next-gen components based simulation framework - the
aircraft is simulated as a connection of **thousands of individual components**.
From an instrument needle to control surfaces, each component influences the
state of the aircraft and even comes with its own **wear and tear**. From simulating
accurate power draw from the power source to the smallest light bulb and all the
nodes along the way, from hydraulic liquid which moves the hydraulics which in
turn move the flight surfaces all the way to a mass physics based model - things
now happen naturally, influenced by each other, and not _scripted_ anymore.
Whether that means that unstable power draw may cause a lamp to flicker, or that
you can deploy your landing gear in case of a failure using gravity, or that
correct and incorrect use of the aircraft influences the wear and tear of each
single component individually - we never before attempted a simulation as deep
as with the F-4E Phantom II. The DCS: F-4 represents some of the most immersive
**cold war fighter jet simulation** available!

Such innovation and in depth simulation will present an increased
learning curve for users. This is why it was important for us to also
innovate on the side of learning tools available to you, starting with this
manual, so that our modules are accessible to the casual simmer and aficionado
alike. You can **open the manual in flight**, and read along, but better still, you
can click any switch (with an input combo) in flight and the manual will open in
the correct chapter, **explaining the switch** or system in the cockpit, all while
you are bolting through the air in your thunderous jet. We also changed the
underlying structure of the manual to move to an **open source** model. This will allow the
community to easily contribute via GitHub, as two heads (or thousands of them) are
better than one. As an added benefit, readability for the mobile version will be greatly improved as
well. We have hyperlinked many items for you, providing easy **navigation** between cockpit diagrams
and system overviews. Also featured in the manual are numerous checklists and procedures, and a   
**"Lessons" section**, which is planned to be featured with the Early Access Release of the Phantom.
The fully written out lessons will complement the flyable training missions. The training missions
are now tailored to be learned together with the written lesson in the manual, you will
be able to revert steps in the training mission, able to read along and pause
(no more restarting for missed items). With all of these features at your disposal, you will be able
to adequately prepare yourself for any mission. And best of all, during your training you will be
instructed by real life F-4 pilots and a real life F-4 WSO Instructor! Who else could teach you
better?

We hope you will enjoy both learning and flying the F-4E Phantom II - diving as
deep as your heart desires. For this exciting journey we wish you **good luck and
many fun adventures**, and of course: always check six!

In the name of the entire Heatblur Team,\
_Nicholas Dackard, Heatblur Simulations, CEO and Founder_
