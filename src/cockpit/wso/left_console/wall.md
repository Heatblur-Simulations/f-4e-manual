Used for emergency deployment of the slats and flaps from the rear cockpit, and
is activated by pulling the handle aft. Pneumatic system powering extension of
the slats flaps system only functions one time. Extend regardless of airspeed,
however flaps will not fully deploy above 230 knots due to air loads on control
surfaces. Will deploy fully when slower.
