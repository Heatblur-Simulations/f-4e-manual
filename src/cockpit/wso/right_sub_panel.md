## Bomb Release Angle Computer

Used to enter the required angle values for [ARBCS/LABS](../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.md)
bombing modes; the Low Angle control may be set from 0 to 89.9 degrees, and the High Angle control
may be set from 70 to 179.9 degrees. The Angle control is used
for [over-the-shoulder bombing,](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment.md#instantaneous-over-the-shoulder---inst-os)
whilst low angle is used for [LOFT bombing](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment.md#loft).
For calculations of the angles we provide a [bombing calculator](../../dcs/bombing_computer.md).

## Bombing Timers

Entry of applicable timing for pull-up signal or release are performed with the
Bombing Timers. The Pull-up timer may be set from 0 to 60 seconds, and the
Release timer may be set from 0 to 30 seconds. Minimum increment for each timer
is 0.1 seconds. The Bombing timers may be used for
every [timed employment method](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment.md).
