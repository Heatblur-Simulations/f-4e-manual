### Battery Bypass

When toggled ON, de-energizes the battery relay, disconnecting the battery from
the essential 28-volt de bus and ceasing charging. Particularly used in
suspected cases of thermal runaway.

### Autopilot Ground Test

The autopilot ground test switch, located on the No. 2 circuit breaker panel, connects external
electrical power to the AFCS circuits. It disengages if there's a loss of external power or when a
generator comes online. When operating on external power, the AFCS circuit can be deenergized by
placing the switch in the NORM (down) position.

### Instrument Ground Power

In the TEST position, connects external electrical power to the instrument buses
(115/200 volt ac, 28 volt ac, and 14 volt ac) , contingent upon the generator
switches being set to EXT ON.
