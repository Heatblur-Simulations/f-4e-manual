## Radar Altimeter

![RadAlt](../../img/RadAlt.png)

Terrain relative accurate height information up to 5000 ft, functions to 30
degrees of bank angle or 35 degrees of pitch. Clockwise rotation of the function
control switch on the lower right of the indicator powers the device; continued
rotation sets the low altitude warning pointer to the desired height. Below the
set altitude, the warning light activates. A self-test, initiated by pressing
the function control switch, shows 35

## Airspeed and Mach Indicator

![MachInd](../../img/MachInd.png)

The combination airspeed and mach number indicator shows airspeed readings below
200 knots, and include Mach numbers at high speed. The indicator uses a single
pointer over a fixed airspeed scale, marked from 80 to 850 knots, with a moving
Mach scale presenting from Mach 0.4 to 2.5. A pair of movable reference markers
is available with the knob on the face of the gauge, with speed reference
available between 80 and 195 knots, and the Mach index pointer being able to be
set between the 225 knot and 850 knot regions relative to the airspeed gauge.

Note: Moving these reference markers outside of the respective aforementioned
regions can damage them.

## Angle of Attack Indicator

![AoAInd](../../img/AoAInd.png)

Drawing relative wind information from the landing-gear adjacent AoA probe, the
AoA indicator offers conditional reference for cruise (7.9 units), approach
(19.2 units), and stall (30.00). Because of the AoA probe to the nose gear door
and subsequent airflow disturbance when the gear is lowered, actual aircraft AoA
is approxiamtely 1 unit higher than indicated, and ON SPEED AoA is roughly 5
knots slower than the given value.

When indicator power is offline due to electrical system configuration or
damage, an OFF flag will appear in the window on the face of the gauge. Function
of the indexer lights and stall warning vibrator is driven by switches in the
indicator.

## Reference System Selector Switch

![RefSel](../../img/RefSel.png)

Toggles between the inertial navigation set and AN/AJB-7 displacement gyroscope
for attitude information. When set to PRIM, the inertial navigation set provides
azimuth and attitude data to the ADI; when on STBY, AN/AJB-7 supplies this
information. Azimuth data also feeds into the HSI and BDHI (rear cockpit).
Additionally, attitude details are sent to the fire control system.

Note: Inertial information requires the inertial navigator control panel's
switch to be on NAV.

When transitioning between STBY and PRIM, immediate attitude information may
show unusual gyrations on the attitude director indicator due to initial
erection. Rapid turns (above 15Â° per minute) may temporarily disrupt accurate
heading information, requiring straight and level flight for about 20 seconds
for manual compass system synchronization (SYNC position)

## Attitude Director Indicator

![ADI](../../img/ADI.png)

Includes an attitude sphere, turn indicator, steering bars, miniature aircraft,
glideslope pointer, flags, and pitch trim knob. It displays pitch, bank, and
heading from the selected reference system and allows pitch adjustment via the
trim knob. The turn indicator relies on a gyro from the AN/AJB-7 system. The
steering bars offer Flight Director guidance for heading interception,
navigation, and ILS approaches. The glideslope pointer provides vertical
guidance information during an ILS approach.

## Horizontal Situation Indicator

![HSI](../../img/HSI.png)

Consists of a rotating compass card, single and double bar bearing pointers
numbered 1 and 2 respectively, a range indicator, and a range warning flag.
Presents a top-down view of the currently programmed navigation. The Heading Set
knob is availble to input desired magnetic heading, and the Course Set knob is
used to enter VOR radial or inbound localizer course for accurate deviation
display.

## Altimeter

![Altim](../../img/Altim.png)

A counter-pointer style altitmeter, with thousandths in the counter window and
100 foot increments around the face. The altimeter has an absolute range of
80,000 feet. The altimeter includes a barometric scale for setting local
pressure with the knob on the indicator. Works in either electric (normal
operation mode) or pneumatic (STBY) mode, switchable via a springloaded three
position switch labelled RESET and STBY.

## Vertical Velocity Indicator

![VVI](../../img/VVI.png)

Provides rate of climb or descent via the static pressure system referenced in
thousands of feet per minute.

## Standby Attitude Indicator

![StbyAtt](../../img/StbyAtt.png)

The SAI functions independent of the Flight Director Group, providing reasonably
accurate readings (within six degrees) for 9 minutes if power to the system is
lost and the OFF flag is in view. Pitch markings are indicated every 5 degrees,
while roll markings are in gradations of 10 degrees. Roll is illustrated through
360 degrees, while pitch is limited by stops at 92 degrees in climb and 78
degrees in dive to prevent gimbal lock.

## Navigation Function Selector Panel

![NavFunct](../../img/NavFunct.png)

Controls display presentation on the ADI and HDI based on the selected values on
the two knobs; to the left is the Bearing/Distance Knob, and to the right the
Mode Selector Knob. The Bearing/Distance Knob determines the source of
navigation information for the HSI and ADI. The Mode Selector Knob provides
control over the presentation of various displayed information on the HSI and
ADI. The Mode Selector Knob includes an inset switch marked FD, for Flight
Director. This switch engages or deactivates the pitch and bank steering bars on
the ADI; the OFF position has the switch aligned vertically.
