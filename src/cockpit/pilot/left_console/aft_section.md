## Anti-G Suit Control Valve

![pilot_anti_g_suit](../../../img/pilot_anti_g_valve.jpg)

The anti-G system delivers low-pressure auxiliary air to the anti-G suits, with air passing through
the anti-G suit control valve before reaching the suit. The suit remains deflated up to
approximately 1.5 G, and as G forces reach or exceed this level, air flows into the suit
proportionally. The suit stays inflated in relation to constant G forces and begins to deflate as G
forces decrease.

A manual inflation button in the anti-G suit control valve enables the crewman to manually inflate
the suit for system checks or fatigue relief. A pressure relief valve within the system activates at
approximately 11 psi, serving as a safety backup in case of malfunction. The system operates
automatically whenever an engine is running, ensuring continuous support for the wearer during
varying G-force conditions.
