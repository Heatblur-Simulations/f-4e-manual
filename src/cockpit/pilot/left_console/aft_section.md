as well as two lamps and a switch to activate flares on its base.

### Chaff Burst

The count knob selects the number of chaff burst commands per salvo;
values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 from left to right.

The interval knob selects the time interval of .1, .2, .3, or .4 seconds
between each chaff burst command.

### Chaff Salvo

if [flaps and speed brakes](../../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md) are retracted.

### Power On Indicator Light

## Anti-G Suit Control Valve

![pilot_anti_g_suit](../../../img/pilot_anti_g_valve.jpg)

The anti-G system delivers low-pressure auxiliary air to the anti-G suits, with air passing through
the anti-G suit control valve before reaching the suit. The suit remains deflated up to
approximately 1.5 G, and as G forces reach or exceed this level, air flows into the suit
proportionally. The suit stays inflated in relation to constant G forces and begins to deflate as G
forces decrease.

A manual inflation button in the anti-G suit control valve enables the crewman to manually inflate
the suit for system checks or fatigue relief. A pressure relief valve within the system activates at
approximately 11 psi, serving as a safety backup in case of malfunction. The system operates
automatically whenever an engine is running, ensuring continuous support for the wearer during
varying G-force conditions.
