## Emergency Slats/Flaps Handle

Also included is the Emergency Slats/Flaps Extension handle, marked in yellow
and black, at the top of the panel. This is handle is pulled to force high
pressure air into the slats/flaps actuation system, causing them to deploy in
event of control system failure.

## Canopy Control Switch

Used to open (aft) or close (forward) the pilot canopy.

## Extra Picture Switch

![ExtraPic](../../../img/ExtraPic.png)

Provision to operate the KB-18 gun camera without the release of weapons, the
Extra Picture switch starts the camera at the selected rate.

## Gun Camera Switch

![GunCamSwtch](../../../img/GunCamSwtch.png)

Activates the gun camera, which will run until the switch is placed to off, or
actuation of bomb button or trigger position 2 once the pre-programmed overrun
time is completed.

## Slats Override Switch

![SlatsOvrd](../../../img/SlatsOvrd.png)

Two-position guarded switch with IN and NORM positions. In NORM, slats operate
normally as a function of the slats flaps switch or AoA. When IN selected, slats
will retract and remain retracted. Selection of IN illuminates SLATS IN light on
telelight panel and Master Caution lamp.

## Armament Safety Override Switch

![ArmOvrd](../../../img/ArmOvrd.png)

If pressed and the landing gear handle is placed down, overrides the armanent
safety.

This allows for example to fire the gun while on ground.
