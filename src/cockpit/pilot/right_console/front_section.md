## Master Caution Reset

![MCRst](../../../img/MCRst.jpg)

Used to extinguish telelight panel warnings and the Master Caution warning lamp
once the necessary action has been taken. In the event a fault has not been
effectively corrected, pressing the Master Caution Reset button will not turn
the respective warning off.

## TACAN Control Panel

![FrontTCN](../../../img/FrontTCN.jpg)

The TACAN Control Panel is used to enter the desired TACAN channel, mode, and
audible volume for the monitoring of said channel by the aircrew. The panel is
duplicated in both cockpits, and the panel in command of the TACAN receiver is
selected with the NAV CMD button of the Communication Control Panel.

On the control panel there are two Navigation Channel Control knobs, with the
left controlling the first two digits of the channel value (hundreds and tens),
and the right controls the single unit (ones) values. The right knob also
includes an outer ring which sets the X or Y value for the desired TACAN
channel.

Between these two knobs is the TEST button, which performs the ground testing
cycle after warmup, and can also be used to perform an in-flight confidence test
of the system's performance.

To the upper right, the VOL knob is available to set the desired audio level for
the received TACAN station.

The TACAN Function Selector Knob determines the presentation and type of
information provided on the HSI, ADI, and BDHI, respectively.

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OFF     | The TACAN receiver is de-energized and offline.                                                                                                            |
| REC     | The TACAN receiver is active, providing bearing information on the HSI, BDHI, and ADI.                                                                     |
| T/R     | Both the receive and transmit functions of the TACAN are active, which provide bearing and nautical mile range information for the HSI and BDHI.           |
| A/A REC | The TACAN receiver decodes bearing information from compliant aircraft for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI steering display.                                        |
| A/A TR  | The TACAN receiver receives both bearing and slant range information in nautical miles from the transmitting aircraft, providing this on the HSI and BDHI. |

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels
above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y. So a tanker on 123Y should
be set to 60Y in the F-4.

## Communication Control Panel

![CCP](../../../img/CCP.jpg)

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in
the aircraft. The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the
radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat;
the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority. In the same fashion,
the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its
button will also illuminate on the panel of the seat that has command (control)
of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat. Close
to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables receiver
squelch.

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A-
auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or
enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold
position (T). The HAVE Quick system provides a resistance against jamming.

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and
Preset/Manual switch. Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2
selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz
in increments of 0.025. With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio
is directly set to the displayed channel. In the Preset position, the set
channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position
selected with the Comm Channel Control knob - the smaller knob to the left of the
Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored
in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels
are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual
switch in the Preset position.

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone
to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick
functionality. It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio
itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob. Selecting the T
position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD
signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function
with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and
Indicator. This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be
changed from in the cockpit.

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the
radio system.

The Aux Volume Control knob raises and lowers the volume of the Aux receiver
channel.

## Utility Panel (Right)

![pilot_utility_panel](../../../img/pilot_utility_panel.jpg)

The utility panel features an emergency vent handle for releasing over pressure in the cockpit.
Furthermore, it features the Defog/Foot Heat Lever as well as the Generator control switches.

## Emergency Vent Handle

![Emergency Vent Handle](../../../img/EmergVent.jpg)

A plug that can be pulled to release cockpit pressure. Putting it back in will
seal the cabin again.

Should only be used if the pressurization system is malfunctioning and reads
abnormal values, or to eliminate smoke and fumes from the cockpit. Descend to safe altitudes before
activating.

## Defog/Foot Heat Lever

![Defog](../../../img/Defog.jpg)

Provides pilot selectable volume of warm air to the windshield for de-icing purposes or footwell
recesses for comfort or visibility.

## Generator Control Switches

![GenCtl](../../../img/GenCtl.jpg)

Control of each engine's respective electrical generator is provided by an
individual switch.
