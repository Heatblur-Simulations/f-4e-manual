# Left Sub-Panel

![LeftSub](../../img/pilot_left_sub_panel_overview.jpg)

The left sub-panel features most
of [the gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md) indicators (
1), [Slats and Flaps](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md#slats-flap-system)
indicators (<num>2</num>), the external lights switch (<num>6</num>), the Aileron-Rudder
Interconnect fuse (<num>8</num>), a recorder
lamp (<num>3</num>), the landing gear lever (<num>9</num>) as well as the fuel boost pump
gauges (<num>4</num>). Also found on it is
the stabilator trim gauge (<num>5</num>) and the emergency release of the external stores
(<num>7</num>).

## 8-Day Clock

![PClock](../../img/pilot_clock.jpg)

A clock is provided for the pilot, including a stopwatch function. The watch features a hour and
minute hand, and can be set by turning
the knob (<num>1</num>) on the left lower corner. The stopwatch function is activated by pressing
the top
right button (<num>2</num>), it features a minute and second hand.
The stopwatch needles are reset by pressing the top right button again.

## Landing Gear Handle

![GearHandle](../../img/pilot_landing_gear_handle.jpg)

Actuates [the landing gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md); raised for
gear up, down for gear down.

Pulling the handle out will actuate the Emergency Mode and release the gear by
using a pair of compressed air bottles.

> ðŸ’¡ The gear can not be retracted on ground.

## Landing Gear Position Indicators

![GearPos](../../img/pilot_landing_gear_position_indicators.jpg)

[The Landing Gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md) Position Indicators
provide visual confirmation of current gear state, displaying UP when retracted, showing a barber
pole while in transition, or the illustration of a wheel in the respective window when fully down
and locked.

## Slats/Flaps Indicators

![SltFlpInd](../../img/pilot_slats_flaps_indicator.jpg)

Visual indication
of [the Slat and Flap systems](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md#slats-flap-system)
are provided through two window indicators. Slats will be displayed as IN (retracted) or OUT (
extended). Flaps will display as UP (retracted) or DN (down), and will show a barber pole while
in transition.

## Boost Pump Pressure Indicators

![BoostInd](../../img/pilot_boost_pump_indicators.jpg)

A pair of indicators provide confirmation of fuel boost pump operation.
Indicators are calibrated 0 to 5, which must be multiplied by 10 to read in
current PSI.

## Stabilator Trim Indicator

![StabTrimInd](../../img/pilot_stabilator_trim_indicator.jpg)

Provides current stabilator trim setting in units of trim (not equal to degrees). For Takeoff the
trim should be between 1-3 units nose down.

## Landing/Taxi Lights Switch

![LndTxLt](../../img/pilot_landing_taxi_lights.jpg)

Control the [external Landing and Taxi lamps.](../../systems/lighting.md) Left main gear must be
down and locked for the switch to function

> ðŸ’¡ Lights are turned off automatically when the gear is retracted.

## External Stores Emergency Release

![EmerRel](../../img/pilot_external_stores_emergency_release.jpg)

Also called the "_panic button_", the External Stores Emergency Release will
immediately perform separation of all stores, without [air-to-air
weapons](../../stores/air_to_air/overview.md) or special weapons.

## Aileron Rudder Interconnect (ARI) Circuit Breaker

![ARI Fuse](../../img/pilot_ari.jpg)

When pulled in conjunction with the Yaw ARI Stab Aug Switch disengaged, Yaw ARI
will be fully removed. With the Yaw ARI Stab Aug Switch engaged, 5 degrees of
ARI authority will be maintained.

See [3.1.2 Flight controls & AFCS](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md#aileron-rudder-interconnect-ari)
for further information.

## Emergency Brake Handle

![EBrake](../../img/pilot_emergency_brake_handle.jpg)

Pulling this handle activates the Emergency Hydraulic Brake System, dumping the remaining pressure
of the hydraulic accumulator in to the brake system for a limited number of brake applications. Note
that differential braking will work as normal, but will also serve to exhaust hydraulic pressure
more quickly.
