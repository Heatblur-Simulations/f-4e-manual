The left sub-panel features most
of [the gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md) indicators as well as the
fuel boost pump gauges. Also found on it is the stabilator trim gauge and the emergency release of
the external stores.

Used for emergency ground extraction, the Emergency Canopy Jettison Handle
releases a compressed oxygen cylinder to open the respective canopy immediately,
shearing it off at its pivots.

## Landing Gear Handle

![GearHandle](../../img/pilot_landing_gear_handle.jpg)

Actuates [the landing gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md); raised for
gear up, down for gear down.

Pulling the handle out will actuate the Emergency Mode and release the gear by
using a pair of compressed air bottles.

> ðŸ’¡ The gear can not be retracted on ground.

## Landing Gear Position Indicators

![GearPos](../../img/pilot_landing_gear_position_indicators.jpg)

[The Landing Gear](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.md) Position Indicators
provide visual confirmation of current gear state, displaying UP when retracted, showing a barber
pole while in transition, or the illustration of a wheel in the respective window when fully down
and locked.

## Slats/Flaps Indicators

![SltFlpInd](../../img/pilot_slats_flaps_indicator.jpg)

Visual indication
of [the Slat and Flap systems](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md#slats-flap-system)
are provided through two window indicators. Slats will be displayed as IN (retracted) or OUT (
extended). Flaps will display as UP (retracted) or DN (down), and will show a barber pole while
in transition.

## Boost Pump Pressure Indicators

![BoostInd](../../img/BoostInd.jpg)

A pair of indicators provide confirmation of fuel boost pump operation.
Indicators are calibrated 0 to 5, which must be multiplied by 10 to read in
current PSI.

## Stabilator Trim Indicator

![StabTrimInd](../../img/pilot_stabilator_trim_indicator.jpg)

Provides current stabilator trim setting in units of trim (not equal to degrees). For Takeoff the
trim should be between 1-3 units nose down.

## Landing/Taxi Lights Switch

![LndTxLt](../../img/LndTxLt.jpg)

Control the [external Landing and Taxi lamps.](../../systems/lighting.md) Left main gear must be
down and locked for the switch to function

> ðŸ’¡ Lights are turned off automatically when the gear is turned in.

## External Stores Emergency Release

![EmerRel](../../img/EmerRel.jpg)

Also called the "_panic button_", the External Stores Emergency Release will
immediately perform separation of all jettison-able stores, without [air-to-air
weapons](../../stores/air_to_air/overview.md) or special weapons.

## Aileron Rudder Interconnect (AIR) Circuit Breaker

![ARI Fuse](../../img/ARIfuse.jpg)

When pulled in conjunction with the Yaw ARI Stab Aug Switch disengaged, Yaw ARI
will be fully removed. With the Yaw ARI Stab Aug Switch engaged, 5 degrees of
ARI authority will be maintained.

See [3.1.2 Flight controls & AFCS](../../systems/flight_controls_gear/flight_controls.md#aileron-rudder-interconnect-ari)
for further information.

## Emergency Brake Handle

![EBrake](../../img/EBrake.jpg)

Pulling this handle activates the Emergency Hydraulic Brake System, which dumps
the remainder of the hydraulic accumulator into the brake system for a limited
number of brake actuation. Differential braking will work, however the number
of available actuations is limited.
