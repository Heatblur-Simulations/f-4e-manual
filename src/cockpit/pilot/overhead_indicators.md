and [LABS](../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.md) bombing runs to provide timing
sequence information to the pilot.

## Standby Magnetic Compass

## Range Indicator

![range_indicator](../../img/range_indicator.jpg)

This panel provides the pilot with a readout of the slant range measured by the
[Pave Spike](../../systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/overview.md) Targeting Pod (x100 ft).

When the Test-Button is pressed, the display shows 888, the knob underneath it
controls the brightness of the readout.

The Mode-Knob allows the pilot to select one of two weapon delivery modes
available with the pod:

- WRCS - Automatic Delivery
- ROR - Release on Range

In the SET position, the display shows the desired release range used in the ROR
mode. The knob below the readout can be used to adjust this range.
