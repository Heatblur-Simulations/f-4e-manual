## Accelerometer

![GGauge](../../img/GGauge.jpg)

Calibrated from negative 4 to positive 10 in units of G, with three pointers -
one for current applied load, the other two show maximum positive and negative G
applied during the flight. Pressing the PUSH TO SET button will reset the
maximum position indicators to 1 G.

## Engine Oil Pressure Indicators

![OilPress](../../img/OilPress.jpg)

A pair of engine oil pressure indicators are provided, one for each engine,
calibrated from 0 to 10, multiplied by 10 to read as units of PSI. Normal values are 15 psi while
the engines are running.

## Hydraulic pressure Indicators

![HydPress](../../img/HydPress.jpg)

Two hydraulic pressure indicators are installed. One references the Utility
Hydraulic System pressure, while the other references the PC-1 and PC-2
Hydraulic Systems; the latter includes two needles, and are marked accordingly. For further
information see the [hydraulics system chapter.](../../systems/hydraulics.md)

## Rounds Remaining Indicator

![Rounds](../../img/Rounds.jpg)

Shows the currently available number of nose gun rounds. The counter must be set
manually by the pilot whenever rearming.

## Rudder Pedal Adjustment Crank

![PedAdjust](../../img/PedAdjust.jpg)

Used to adjust ergonomic position of the rudder pedals forward or back from the
pilot.

Requires 38 full turns to move the pedals across the entire range.

## Pneumatic Pressure Indicator

![Pneumatic Pressure Indicator](../../img/Pneum.jpg)

Provides cumulative manifold pressure of the compressed engine bleed air used to
drive the aircraft's pneumatic actuated equipment. For further information see the [pneumatic system
chapter.](../../systems/pneumatics.md)

## Rate of fire Switch

![pilot_pedestral_group_rate_of_fire_switch](../../img/pilot_pedestral_group_rate_of_fire.jpg)

Used to switch the gun rate of fire between a HIGH setting (6000 rounds per minute) and a LOW
setting (4000 rounds per minute).

## Auto clear switch

![pilot_pedestral_group_auto_clear_switch](../../img/pilot_pedestral_group_auto_clear_switch.jpg)

The cannon will fire approximately between 5 and 11 rounds from the point the pilot has released the
trigger to clear all bolt actions in the cannon. This spin-down takes approximately one second
during which the gun cannot be fired again during this operation. This only applies to externally
carried gun pods and not to the main gun. The auto clear option should be used everytime a gun
pod is used.
