# Pedestal Group

![PedGrp](../../img/pilot_pedestal_group_overview.jpg)

This panel behind the stick offers mostly auxiliary information and controls.

## Accelerometer

![GGauge](../../img/pilot_accelerator.jpg)

Calibrated from negative 4 to positive 10 in units of G, with three pointers -
one for current applied load, the other two show maximum positive and negative G
applied during the flight. Pressing the PUSH TO SET button will reset the
maximum position indicators to 1 G.

## Engine Oil Pressure Indicators

![OilPress](../../img/pilot_engine_oil.jpg)

A pair of engine oil pressure indicators are provided, one for each engine,
calibrated from 0 to 100 PSI. Engine oil is used for lubrication, variable
nozzle positioning, and constant speed drive unit
operation. Important values are:

* 12 PSI - Minimum at idle RPM
* 30-60 PSI - In-flight military
* 35 PSI - Static minimum at military thrust
* 60 PSI - Maximum

For further information see
[3.2.1 Engines chapter](../../systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/engines.md).

## Hydraulic pressure Indicators

![HydPress](../../img/pilot_hydraulic_pressure.jpg)

Two hydraulic pressure indicators are installed. The one on the right, references the Utility
Hydraulic System pressure, while the left one references the PC-1 and PC-2
Hydraulic Systems; the latter includes two needles, which are marked accordingly.
Pressure transmitters, one for
each system, convert pressure impulses to electrical
impulses which, in turn, are supplied to the indicators.
Nominal operating power for all three systems
is 3000 Â±250 PSI. Other important values are:

* 2000-2750 - Normal with rapid control movement
* 2750-3250 - Normal
* 3250-3400 - If pressure exceeds 3250 steady state, and entry must be logged on form 781
* 3400 - Maximum

For further information see [3.5 Hydraulics chapter](../../systems/hydraulics.md).

## Pneumatic Pressure Indicator

![Pneumatic Pressure Indicator](../../img/pilot_pneumatic.jpg)

Shows manifold pressure of the pneumatic system
measured by the pressure transmitter which supplies
electrical inputs to the indicator.
Keep in mind it doesn't show individual
emergency pneumatic bottle pressures.
Normal system pressure range is from 2650 to 3300 psi
due to pressure transmitter and pressure gage tolerances.

Other important values are:

* 3300-3500 - Caution area
* 3500 - Maximum

For further information see the [3.6 Pneumatics chapter](../../systems/pneumatics.md).

## Screen Source Switch

![Screen Source Switch](../../img/pilot_radar_tv_switch.jpg)

Controls which video source is displayed on the DSCG screen.
This is independent of the WSO, allowing the pilot to view a source different to the WSO.

In the Radar position, the radar will be displayed on the screen. TV will either
display weapon feeds, such as Maverick, or the targeting pod camera;
depending on the [Video Select Button](../wso/left_sub_panel.md#video-select-button)
in the WSO cockpit.

The Off-position turns the screen off.

## Rate of fire Switch

![pilot_pedestral_group_rate_of_fire_switch](../../img/pilot_rate_switch.jpg)

Used to switch the gun rate of fire between a HIGH setting (6000 rounds per minute) and a LOW
setting (4000 rounds per minute).

## Auto clear switch

![pilot_pedestral_group_auto_clear_switch](../../img/pilot_clear_switch.jpg)

The cannon will fire approximately between 5 and 11 rounds from the point the pilot has released the
trigger to clear all bolt actions in the cannon. This spin-down takes approximately one second
during which the gun cannot be fired again during this operation. This only applies to externally
carried gun pods and not to the main gun.

The AUTO CLEAR option should be used whenever a gun pod is used.

## Rounds Remaining Indicator

![Rounds](../../img/pilot_rounds_remaining.jpg)

Shows the currently available number of nose gun rounds. The counter must be set
manually by the pilot whenever rearming.

## Shrike Controls

Two switches to control [AGM-45 Shrikes](../../stores/air_to_ground/missiles/shrike.md)
settings.

### TGT/MLS Reject Switch

![pilot_shrike_tgt_reject](../../img/pilot_tgt_missile_reject.jpg)

Selects which target source to use and select, either TGT/MSL REJ, ALL or DF REJ.

### Band Switch

![pilot_shrike_tgt_reject](../../img/pilot_shrike_band.jpg)

Selects the bands to pickup by the weapon.

## Rudder Pedal Adjustment Crank

![PedAdjust](../../img/pilot_pedal_adjust.jpg)

Used to adjust ergonomic position of the rudder pedals forward or back from the
pilot.

Requires 38 full turns to move the pedals across the entire range.
