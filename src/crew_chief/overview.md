# Crew Chief

## Introduction
Crew chief (commonly called "chief") is the main technician which is responsible for the assigned aircraft when it's on the ground and keeps it in a good condition. Not only conducts maintenance but also prepares aircraft for flight. The preparation starts before the aircraft crew arrives but the chief also assists the crew during startup and shutdown.

## Features
Our F-4 crew chief has expertise in many fields including:
* External power (provided by ground cart)
* External air (provided by ground cart)
* Engine start cartridges
* Wheel chocks
* Boarding ladder and boarding steps
* Different visual checks (listed below)

## Visual Checks
In the F-4 checklists there are several ground checks which objective is to make sure that certain system are working and set correctly. Crew chief can help the pilot conduct following checks:
* **Spoiler Actuator**
* Air Refuelling Door
* Speed Brakes
* Slats and Flaps
* **Flight Controls**
* **Trim (roll and yaw)**
* Tail Hook

Some of these checks are triggered automatically (e.g. when the chief notices speed brakes extending/retracting, he will announce it) but more advanced ones (the bolded ones) has to be initiated manually.

Some of them can also be conducted without crew chief, by acquiring visual confirmation from the WSO, but not all of them because the visibility from the cockpit is limited.

## Communication
Both crewmembers can communicate with the chief using one of the 2 methods:
* Intercom - crew chief's headset is connected to the aircraft intercom system using a cable providing 2-way communication similar to the communication between Pilot and WSO
>Since the external intercom is wired in parallel with the WSO's microphone and headset, the ground crew and WSO can block each other during simultaneous transmissions. In addition, the WSO's function selector switch must be in **HOT MIC** to allow aircraft to ground communications.
* Hand signals - when this method is used, the crew chief features are limited; for example you will be able to ask for the simpler actions like the wheel chocks removal but you can't conduct more advanced ones like flight controls check

In both modes you can communicate with the crew chief using Jester wheel "Crew Chief" menu. The aircraft has to be stationary and on friendly airfield for the menu to be available.

If the intercom system is set up correctly and powered up, the intercom mode will be active, otherwise hand signals mode will be used and the "(hand signals)" will be added to the "Crew Chief" menu name to indicate that.

## TODO
* explain features a bit more
* add some images
