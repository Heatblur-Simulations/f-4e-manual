## Introduction

Crew chief (often called "Chief") is the main technician
who is responsible for the assigned aircraft when it's on the ground.
This important role involves not only keeping the aircraft in good shape
by conducting maintenance, but also preparing it for flight.
The preparation for take off starts long before the aircraft crew arrives,
but the chief also directly assists the crew during startup and shutdown.

## Features

Our F-4 crew chief has expertise in many fields including:

* External power (provided by ground cart)
* External air (provided by ground cart)
* Engine start cartridges
* Wheel chocks
* Boarding ladder and boarding steps
* Conducting different visual checks (listed below)

## Visual Checks

The F-4 [procedures](../procedures/startup.md) include several ground checks, which objective is to
make sure that certain systems are working and set correctly.
Our F-4 crew chief can assist the pilot during following checks:

* **Spoiler Actuator**
* Air Refuelling Door
* Speed Brakes
* Slats and Flaps
* **Flight Controls**
* **Trim (roll and yaw)**
* Tail Hook

Some of them are triggered automatically
(e.g. when the chief notices speed brakes extending/retracting, he will announce it).
More advanced checks (bold ones) have to be initiated manually.

Some of them can also be conducted without crew chief, by acquiring visual confirmation from the WSO,
but not all of them because of the limited visibility from the cockpit.

## Communication

Both crewmembers can communicate with the chief using one of two methods:

* Intercom - crew chief's headset is connected to the aircraft [intercom system](../systems/nav_com/intercom.md)
using a cord providing 2-way communication similar to the communication between Pilot and WSO
* Hand signals - the aircraft crew communicates with the chief in 1-way fashion using hand signals;
when this method is used, the crew chief features are limited;
you will be able to ask for the simpler actions like the wheel chocks removal
but the crew chief won't help you in conducting visual checks

In both modes you can communicate with the crew chief using Jester wheel "Crew Chief" menu.
The aircraft has to be stationary and located on a friendly airfield for the menu to be available.

If the intercom system is set up correctly and powered up, the intercom mode will be active,
otherwise hand signals mode will be used and
the "(hand signals)" will be added to the "Crew Chief" menu name to indicate that.

>ðŸ’¡Since the external intercom is wired in parallel with the WSO's microphone and headset,
the ground crew and WSO can block each other during simultaneous transmissions.
In addition, the WSO's function selector switch must be in **HOT MIC** to allow aircraft to ground communications.

Keep in mind that you can verify the 2-way communication
by using "Comms Check" option.

## TODO

* explain features a bit more (especially visual checks)
* add some images
* ARI/AFCS check
