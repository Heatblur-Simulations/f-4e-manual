![Wing Tanks](../img/wing_tanks_loaded.jpg)

To extend reach, the Phantom can equip up to three external fuel tanks,
nicknamed _Sargent Fletcher Tanks_:

- 1x 600 gallons external centerline
- 2x 370 gallons external wing tank

They can also all be loaded simultaneously, increasing the total amount of
fuel from 12896 lb without any tanks to a striking 21606 lb, doubling the reach.

![Center Tank](../img/center_tank_loaded_cold_start.jpg)

With one center tank loaded, the total amount is 16796 lb,
while with both wing tanks it is 17706 lb.

See the [3.2.2. Fuel chapter](../systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/fuel_system.md) for
details on how to operate the tanks.
