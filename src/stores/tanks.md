To extend reach, the Phantom can equip up to three external fuel tanks,
nicknamed _Sargent Fletcher Tanks_:

- 1x 600 gallons external centerline
- 2x 370 gallons external wing tank

They can also all be loaded simultaneously, increasing the total amount of
fuel from 12896 lb without any tanks to a striking 21606 lb, doubling the reach.

![Center Tank](../img/center_tank_loaded_cold_start.jpg)

With one center tank loaded, the total amount is 16796 lb,
while with both wing tanks it is 17706 lb.

The wing tanks are equipped on the outer pylons.

See the [3.2.2. Fuel chapter](../systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/fuel_system.md) for
details on how to operate the tanks.
