# TV Guided Bombs

The F-4E Phantom II was equipped with TV-guided bombs, notably the GBU-8 and
AGM-62 Walleye, enhancing its precision strike capabilities.

The GBU-8, also known as the "HOBOS" (Homing Bomb System), and the AGM-62
Walleye are both electro-optical, TV-guided glide bombs. They are
precision-guided munition equipped with a television camera in their nose.

Both can be steered after being launched via a data-link interface, leading to
pinpoint precision and increasing the F-4E's effectiveness in attacking
well-defended and high-value targets, providing a "man-in-the-loop" guidance
solution.

> ðŸ’¡ The earlier DSCG variant does not support the data-link interface. Thus, it
> can launch the weapons only in a backup mode _"Lock-On Before Launch"_ similar
> to Mavericks, without any manual steering after launch.

Both the GBU-8 and AGM-62 Walleye were crucial additions to the F-4E's arsenal,
enhancing its ability to conduct precise strikes with reduced collateral damage.
These TV-guided bombs showcased the adaptability of the F-4E Phantom II in
integrating advanced munitions to meet evolving mission requirements.

| GBU-15            | 2000 lb | extended range            |

## Employment

Only the pilot can lock and launch these weapons. To release either bomb, select
the corresponding stations, put the Weapon Selector to TV and the Delivery Mode
Knob to DIRECT.

Enable the TV mode for the DSCG screen and press the trigger. This activates the
sensor and video feed will be displayed on the screen.

The camera sensor can not be moved. Place the crosshair in the general direction
of the target area, or in case of launching in _"Lock-On Before Launch"_-mode,
directly over the target. Press and hold down the trigger to command a lock.

Once locked, a black square is added to the symbology, indicating the seeker
head position.

Then, press and hold the bomb button for a few seconds. The weapon automatically
releases when the target is within range.

> ðŸ’¡ Effective range varies a lot with release altitude and speed. If the
> weapons do not release, climb and increase speed.
