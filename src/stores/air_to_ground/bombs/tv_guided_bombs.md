# TV Guided Bombs

The F-4E Phantom II was equipped with TV-guided bombs, notably the GBU-8 and AGM-62 Walleye,
enhancing its precision strike capabilities. The GBU-8, also known as the "HOBOS" (Homing Bomb
System), was a laser-guided bomb developed for the F-4E Phantom II. It featured a semi-active laser
seeker that required external laser designation from the launching aircraft or a designated
third-party source. This bomb significantly improved the F-4E's accuracy in hitting designated
targets, especially those with pinpoint precision requirements. he AGM-62 Walleye was an
electro-optical, TV-guided glide bomb employed by the F-4E. This precision-guided munition had a
television camera in its nose, allowing the pilot to visually guide the bomb to its target by
watching a live video feed. The Walleye increased the F-4E's effectiveness in attacking
well-defended and high-value targets, as it provided a "man-in-the-loop" guidance system.

Both the GBU-8 and AGM-62 Walleye were crucial additions to the F-4E's arsenal, enhancing its
ability to conduct precise strikes with reduced collateral damage. These TV-guided bombs showcased
the adaptability of the F-4E Phantom II in integrating advanced munitions to meet evolving mission
requirements.
