# TV Guided Bombs

![Phantom loaded with two Walleyes](../../../img/walleyes_loaded.jpg)

The F-4E Phantom II was equipped with TV-guided bombs, notably the GBU-8 and
AGM-62 Walleye, enhancing its precision strike capabilities.

The GBU-8, also known as the "HOBOS" (Homing Bomb System), its successor the
GBU-15, and the AGM-62 I and II Walleye are electro-optical, TV-guided
glide bombs. They are precision-guided munition equipped with a television
camera in their nose.

The GBU-15, as well as both Walleye variants can be steered after being launched
via a data-link interface, leading to pinpoint precision and increasing the
F-4E's effectiveness in attacking well-defended and high-value targets,
providing a "man-in-the-loop" guidance solution.

> ðŸ’¡ The earlier DSCG variant does not support the data-link interface. Thus, it
> can launch the weapons only in a backup mode _"Lock-On Before Launch"_ similar
> to Mavericks, without any manual steering after launch.

Both the GBU-8/15 and AGM-62 Walleye were crucial additions to the F-4E's
arsenal, enhancing its ability to conduct precise strikes with reduced
collateral damage. These TV-guided bombs showcased the adaptability of the F-4E
Phantom II in integrating advanced munitions to meet evolving mission
requirements.

## Employment

Only the pilot can lock and launch these weapons. To release either bomb, select
the corresponding stations, put the Weapon Selector to TV and the Delivery Mode
Knob to DIRECT.

Enable the TV mode for the DSCG screen and press the trigger. This activates the
sensor and video feed will be displayed on the screen.

The camera sensor can not be moved. Place the crosshair in the general direction
of the target area, or in case of launching in _"Lock-On Before Launch"_-mode,
directly over the target. Press and hold down the trigger to command a lock.

The seeker attempts to lock via contrast. If it fails to lock, the target likely does
not stand out enough to its background.

> ðŸ’¡ Due to TV based contrast-locking, the weapons effectiveness may decrease
> during dusk, dawn or in heavy overcast situations.

Once locked, a black square is added to the symbology, indicating the seeker
head position.

Then, press and hold the bomb button for a few seconds. The weapon automatically
releases when the target is within range.

> ðŸ’¡ Effective range varies a lot with release altitude and speed. If the
> weapons do not release, climb and increase speed.
