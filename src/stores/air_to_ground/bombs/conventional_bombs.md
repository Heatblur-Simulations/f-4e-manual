# Conventional Bombs

## Mk 80 Series

![mk80s](../../../img/mk80s.jpg)

The Phantom II's bread and butter in the air to ground role, the Mk 80 series
conventional bombs were first dropped in combat over North Vietnam. The F-4E is
able to deliver the 500 lb Mk 82, the 1000 lb Mk 83, and 2000 lb Mk 84. Of note
is the selectable drag option Mk 82 variant known as Snakeye. With the
selectable fin arrangement on the round, the deployable fins remain in position
in the low drag profile, and deploy as a cruciform aerobraking device in the
high drag setting. This change in setting is managed with the Nose/Tail Arming
switch.

the BDU-33 25 lb training bomb, the BDU-45 500 lb training bomb, or the BDU-50
500 lb training bomb, in either low or high drag configuration, to simulate the
carriage and release profile of standard Mk 82 and Snakeye rounds.

## Employment

The conventional bombs are deployed using the BOMBS setting on the
[Weapon Selector Knob](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#weapon-selector-knob).

All bombing modes on the
[Delivery Mode Knob](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#delivery-mode-knob)
are supported, see the [4.3.3.6. Employment](employment/overview.md) section for
details.

> 💡 MK-82 Air and Snakeye can be switched between Low and High drag
> configuration depending on the
> [Fuze Arm Switch](../../../systems/weapon_systems/multiple_weapons_system.md#nosetail-arm-switch).
> The nose fuze arms the bomb, while the tail fuze puts the bomb into High Drag
> if set and Low Drag if not set.
