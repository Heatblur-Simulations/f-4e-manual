# Conventional Bombs

## Mk 80 Series

![mk80s](../../../img/mk80s.jpg)

The Phantom II's bread and butter in the air to ground role, the Mk 80 series
conventional bombs were first dropped in combat over North Vietnam. The F-4E is
able to deliver the 500 lb Mk 82, the 1000 lb Mk 83, and 2000 lb Mk 84. Of note
is the selectable drag option Mk 82 variant known as Snakeye. With the
selectable fin arrangement on the round, the deployable fins remain in position
in the low drag profile, and deploy as a cruciform aerobraking device in the
high drag setting. This change in setting is managed with the Nose/Tail Arming
switch.

Carrying 247 Mk 118 anti-tank bomblets, the Mk 20 Rockeye is used to deliver
said potency across a wide dispersal area. The Mk 20 has a base schedule
dispersal time depending on variant (4 seconds in the Mod 2 variant, and 1.2
seconds in the Mod 3), along with a ground crew selectable option time that is
