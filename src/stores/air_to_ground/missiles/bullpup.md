The AGM-12, nicknamed Bullpup, is a guided short-range air-to-ground missile
that can be steered manually by the crew.

Steering commands are send via radio by utilizing the lower UHF antenna of the
Phantom.

It was the first of its kind that reached series production and was used in
service during the early 1960s until it was later supplanted by the
[AGM-62 Walleye](../bombs/tv_guided_bombs.md).

### Basic cockpit setup

Before any AGM-12 Bullpup can be employed a few things have to be set in the cockpit by the pilot:

1. Select the station for the AGM-12 Bullpup via
   the [station select buttons](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#station-select-buttons)
2. Select AGM-12 on
   the [weapon select knob](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#weapon-selector-knob)
3. Select Direct on
   the [delivery mode knob](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#delivery-mode-knob)
4. (optional) Turn the LCOSS to A/G
5. Turn [MASTER ARM](../../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#master-arm-switch) on

To launch the AGM-12 Bullpup the only thing left to do is to put the reticle on the target and press
and hold the bomb release button until the missile has left the rail.After launch, the weapon can be
steered either by the pilot using the mini-stick next to the throttle, or by the WSO using the
Antenna Hand Control Stick.
