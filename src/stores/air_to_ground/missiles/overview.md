# Missiles

Among the Phantom II's lethal armament are the AGM-65 Maverick, AGM-45 Shrike, and AGM-12 Bullpup
missiles, each playing a distinct role in the aircraft's capacity to engage ground targets and
neutralize enemy threats.

The [AGM-65 Maverick](maverick.md), a precision-guided air-to-ground missile, uses its versatile
guidance systems, including electro-optical and infrared seekers, to allow pilots to engage a
variety of ground-based threats.

The [AGM-45 Shrike](shrike.md) missile takes on a specialized role in Suppression of Enemy Air
Defenses (SEAD). Designed to seek out and neutralize enemy radar installations, the Shrike is an
anti-radiation missile that targets radar-emitting threats.

The [AGM-12 Bullpup](bullpup.md), a radio-controlled guided short-range air-to-ground missile that
can be steered manually by the crew allowing them to engage ground-based threats.
