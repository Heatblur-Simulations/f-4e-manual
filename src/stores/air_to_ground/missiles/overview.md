# Missiles

In the relentless pursuit of air superiority and ground strike capabilities, the F-4E Phantom II
stands distinguished, owing much of its versatility to a diverse array of missiles. Among the
notable contributors to the Phantom II's lethal armament are the AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-45 Shrike
missiles, each playing a distinct role in the aircraft's capacity to engage ground targets and
neutralize enemy threats. This section explores the unique characteristics and contributions of
these two missiles, highlighting their significance in shaping the Phantom II's formidable
reputation.

## AGM-65 Maverick: Precision in Air-to-Ground Capabilites

The AGM-65 Maverick, a precision-guided air-to-ground missile, epitomizes the F-4E's commitment to
surgical strikes on ground targets. With its versatile guidance systems, including electro-optical
and infrared seekers, the Maverick allows pilots to engage a variety of ground-based threats with
unparalleled accuracy. Whether tasked with destroying armored vehicles or fortified structures, the
AGM-65 Maverick's adaptability and precision make it a cornerstone in the F-4E's air-to-ground
capabilities. This missile ensures that the Phantom II can deliver targeted and effective strikes,
minimizing collateral damage while maximizing mission success.

## AGM-45 Shrike: The answer to the air defense

In the dynamic and contested airspace where the F-4E Phantom II operates, the AGM-45 Shrike missile
takes on a specialized role in Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD). Designed to seek out and
neutralize enemy radar installations, the Shrike is an anti-radiation missile that disrupts the
adversary's ability to detect and target friendly aircraft. By targeting radar-emitting threats, the
AGM-45 Shrike enhances the survivability of the Phantom II and other friendly assets, allowing them
to operate with reduced risk in hostile environment
