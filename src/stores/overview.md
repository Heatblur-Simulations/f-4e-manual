# Weapons & Stores

As a cornerstone of air forces around the globe, the F-4E's effectiveness is not only attributed to
its advanced avionics and airframe design but also to its formidable array of weapons and stores.

The F-4E features three main types of [Air-to-Air](./air_to_air/overview.md) Weaponry including
Heat-Seeking Missiles with the [AIM-9](./air_to_air/aim_9.md) in
different [variants,](./air_to_air/aim_9.md#variants) the semi-active radar homing
missile [AIM-7](./air_to_air/aim_7.md) in different [variants](./air_to_air/aim_7.md#variants) and
a [M61A1 Vulcan cannon](./guns.md#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan) that can be used against Air and
Ground Targets.

The aircraft can be armed with a variety
of [bombs,](./air_to_ground/bombs/overview.md) [rockets,](./air_to_ground/rockets.md)
and [guided munitions](./air_to_ground/missiles/overview.md) to engage and neutralize ground
targets. Precision-guided munitions, such
as [laser-guided bombs,](./air_to_ground/bombs/laser_guided_bombs.md) enable the Phantom II to
strike high-value targets with precision, minimizing collateral damage and maximizing
mission success.

In addition to its lethal armament, the F-4E can be configured
with [external fuel tanks](./tanks.md) to extend
its operational range. The aircraft can also carry specialized stores,
including [targeting pods](./pods.md#anavq-23-pave-spike)
and [electronic warfare (EW) systems.](./pods.md#alq-131-ecm-pod)
