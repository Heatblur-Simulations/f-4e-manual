# Virtual Browser

To enhance in-flight studies of the aircraft or simply to overcome some downtime,
a virtual browser can be opened (by default <kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>).

The browser enables users to

* watch tutorial videos,
* read documentation provided by third parties,
* listen to a music playlist while flying,
* or also playing some browser games and much more.

The UI is embedded in-game, can be resized and moved around. Buttons on the
top left corner allow for quick navigation.

> ðŸ’¡ The virtual browser is feature-rich and supports almost the entire set of HTML 5.
> See [HTML 5 Test Result](https://html5test.co/s/?b40343682d61460f) for a detailed list.

> ðŸš§ The Virtual Browser is temporarily disabled and will be made available later again.

## Session

Session data is memorized and saved locally in a folder like

`C:\Users\John Doe\Saved Games\DCS_F4E\cache\`

Clearing this folder will reset all browser preferences and settings.

If required, sound level of the browser can be controlled via the volume mixer provided by Windows
through the **HeatblurUi.exe** entry.
