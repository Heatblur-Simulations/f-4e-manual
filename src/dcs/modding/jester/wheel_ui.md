# Wheel UI

Jester Wheel consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua
for modifying its content and reacting to actions.

## Frontend

The frontend is a [Pixi JS](https://pixijs.com/) based website defined in

`f-4e\ModFolders\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\UI\JesterWheel`

Opening `index.html` in a browser shows the wheel filled with the base content.

The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS
(<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).

The UI logic, such as animations are defined in `renderer.js`, while the
interactions are handled in `main.js`.

`interface.js` declares the base content of the wheel, as well as all methods
relevant for the C++ to JS communication.

The method `hb_send_proxy` is used to send commands to C++, such as notifying it
that an action has been clicked.

## Lua

The wheel is essentially a menu-tree. Each menu consists of up to 8 items. An
item might be final or contain another sub-menu. Additionally, a sub-menu can
also be spawned as outer-menu, which increases its item slots to 18.

Each item can be associated with an `action`, a string that is tied to the Event
System and can hence be reacted to if invoked.

To interact with the menu, several methods are defined and exported to Lua:

```lua
Wheel.ReplaceMainMenu(main_menu)
Wheel.ReplaceSubMenu(sub_menu, menu_location)
Wheel.AddItem(item, menu_location)
Wheel.RemoveItem(item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.ReplaceItem(item, item_name, menu_location)
```

The following shows a simple example to add a new sub-menu to the `Navigation`
menu:

```lua
local waypoint_menu = Wheel.Item:new({
  name = "Select Waypoint",
  menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
    name = "Select Waypoint",
    items = {
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 1", action = "select_tgt_1" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "TGT 2", action = "select_tgt_2" }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Advanced", outer_menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
        name = "More Waypoints",
        items = {
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "RTB", action = "select_rtb" }),
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = "Nearest Target", action = "select_tgt" }),
        },
      })}),
    }
  }),
})

Wheel.AddItem(waypoint_menu, {"Navigation"})
```

To react to a selected action, listen to the corresponding event:

```lua
ListenTo("select_tgt_1", function()
  Click(
    devices.NavigationComputer_AN_ASN_46A,
    device_commands.RIO_NAV_COMP_FUNCTION_SELECTOR_KNOB,
    3,
    5
  ) -- Target 1
end)
```
