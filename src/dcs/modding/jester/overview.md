# Jester

Jester is fully open to modding via a Lua-API. Any feature and functionality of Jester
has been written by using this API.

> ðŸ’¡ Mission designers can enforce an unmodified Jester.
> See chapter [9.10. Mission Editor](../../mission_editor.md#allow-jester-modifications) for details.

The Jester AI primarily consists of:

* logic - written with the [Lua-API](lua_api.md)
* user interface - embedded websites for the [Wheel](wheel_ui.md) and [Dialogs](dialog_ui.md)
* sounds - see [Voice Files](voice_files.md)

> ðŸ’¡ Let us know if you create a cool Jester mod that you think should make
> its way into the module!
