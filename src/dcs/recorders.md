# Recorders

The aircraft is equipped with multiple recording devices, such as the AVTR or
the Gun Camera.

They are capable of recording in-game footage, which is accessible outside of
the game in the **Saved Games** folder. A possible path might for example look
like:

`C:\Users\John Doe\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\F-4E\recorders\`
