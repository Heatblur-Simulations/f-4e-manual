# Recorders

The aircraft is equipped with multiple recording devices, such as the AVTR or
the Gun Camera.

They are capable of recording in-game footage, which is accessible outside of
the game in the **Saved Games** folder. A possible path might for example look
like:

`C:\Users\John Doe\Saved Games\DCS_F4E\recorders\`

## Airborne Video Tape Recorder

The AVTR records footage into folder

`C:\Users\John Doe\Saved Games\DCS_F4E\recorders\avtr\`

as PNG files every three seconds, if activated. Each cassette can record up to 20 minutes of footage
and, if unthreaded, will overwrite previously recorded footage.

> 💡 This limits the footage to 400 files, each having a size between 50 KB (radar) to 400 KB (TV),
> totalling to 160 MB.

See [2.1.10.3 AVTR System](../cockpit/pilot/right_console/aft_section.md#airborne-video-tape-recorder)
and [2.2.2 AVTR Control](../cockpit/wso/left_sub_panel.md#avtr-control)
for details on how to operate the device.
