# Pave Spike

If equipped, Jester will ensure the targeting pod is ready for a 12-VIS dive
attack when required.

This can also be commanded manually by selecting either
`Air To Ground > Pave Spike > Operation > Standby` or
`Air To Ground > Pave Spike > Operation > Ready` in the UI.

Additionally, the UI allows the pilot to change the laser code used by Pave
Spike.

The pilot can command Jester to focus on operating the targeting pod by
selecting TGT FIND on the Delivery Mode Knob.

> ðŸ’¡ Due to DSCG limitations, operation of the Pave Spike and the radar system
> are mutually exclusive.

## 12-VIS Dive

Pressing the **Context Action** will command Jester to lock the ground target
next to the reticle. A subsequent press will unlock the target again.

This can be used effectively in 12-VIS mode where the pilot points the nose on
the target in a short dive. After locking the target, the pilot can pull out of
the dive and either keep observing the target through the pod, or start an
attack. See
[4.3.3.4. Employment](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/employment.md#target-find---tgt-find)
for details.

> ðŸš§ Jester Pave Spike operation will be expanded throughout Early Access. To
> overcome current limitations, the Pilot is provided with temporary binds to
> control the WSOs Antenna Stick. This allows the pilot to use the targeting pod
> more effectively.
