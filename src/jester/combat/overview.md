# Combat

Jesters assistance for combat situations is generally divided into options on
the Jester Wheel, whenever not in a high action environment yet, and a smart
**Context Action** for use during situations that require acting quick, such as
during a fight.

## Context Action

The context command (by default <kbd>V</kbd>) allows for intuitive cooperation
and exchange between Pilot and WSO based on the following contexts:

- Pave Spike - TGT FIND selected on the Delivery Mode Knob
- Dive Toss - DT or DL selected on the Delivery Mode Knob
- Dogfight - CAGE mode
- Beyond Visual Range - other

The context action can change semantics if pressed only momentarily, if hold or
if clicked twice (double-click).
