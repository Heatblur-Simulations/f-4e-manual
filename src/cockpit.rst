The IN RANGE light illuminates to alert the pilot that the current locked target is within range parameters.


Hold Altitude Light
-------------------   

.. image:: images/HoldAlt.png
  
  
The HOLD ALT light illuminates as an instruction to the pilot from the fire control system to maintain current altitude to assist in a snap-up intercept situation against a target above the fighter.  The predicates are:

A range greater than the weapon can make,
Altitude in excess than 32,000 feet, and
The locked taret is greater than 8,000 feet above the fighter.

When the HOLD ALT light is on, the fighter should be flown to center the steering dot relative to azimuth of the ASE circle.  When the HOLD ALT light turns off, the fighter should then snap up in pitch to fully center the steering dot in the ASE circle.

Otherwise, the indicator displays M if the radio is set to Manual, G when the COMM function is set
as GUARD/ADF, or A when the A-3-2-T switch is in A.


True Airspeed Indicator
-----------------------

.. image:: images/TASInd.png
  
  
Provides the aircraft's true Airspeed in knots, and is calibrated from 150 to 1500 knots; airspeeds below this range are thus not reliable. At high rates of airspeed change, there may be a lag of up to +-10 knots in measurement. 


Flight Instrument Brightness Knob
---------------------------------

.. image:: images/InstruBright.png
  
  
Controls brightness of the flight instrument cluster.

Rotating clockwise will increase brightness of all flight instrument lights,
while at the same time dim the HSI mode and warning and caution lights, except FIRE and OVERHEAT.

Flight instrument lights can additionally be controlled individually
with knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel, located on the right wall.


Nose/Tail Arming Switch
-----------------------

.. image:: images/NTArm.png
  
  
Controls the arming solenoids of the MER and TER racks, selecting what MER/TER position(s) arming lanyards are pulled from released bomb fuzes upon separation, thus making them live.  This function also controls selective low/high drag capability for retarded bombs.

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SAFE      | No arming solenoids activate; bombs release without fuzing enabled.               |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOSE      | Forward and center position solenoids activate to hold arming lanyards.           |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TAIL      | Aft position solenoids activate to hold arming lanyards.                          |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOSE/TAIL | Forward, center, and aft position solenoids all activate to hold arming lanyards. |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Station Select Buttons 
----------------------

.. image:: images/SSBs.png
   
  
The Station Select Buttons are used to activate air to ground munition stations and the nose gun.
Upon selection of a station, the upper half denoting the position will illuminate green to confirm the
station is active.
The lower half will illuminate amber once the necessary mode is selected,
the weapon is compatible with the weapon select knob option, the Master Arm is in the ARM position,
and any necessary warm up period for the selected weapon type is completed.
L and R positions are left and right, respectively, with O denoting outboard and I 
denoting inboard stations.
The centerline weapon position is CL, and the nose gun is armed with the GUN station selector button.

A dimmer knob is also provided to raise or lower the lighting of the station select buttons relative
to current cockpit conditions. If the Flight Instrument Brightness Knob above it is set to the full CCW position,
it overrides the dimmer knob and Station Select Buttons are always illuminated at full brightness.


Master Arm Switch
-----------------

.. image:: images/MArm.png
  
  
Provides master arming function for all aircraft weapons.  


Delivery Mode Knob
------------------

.. image:: images/DelMode.png
  
  
The Delivery Mode Knob sets the fire control system to the desired air to ground weapon release type.  Split into two halves, the left side of the dial references ARBCS (Altitude Reference and Bombing Computer Set) delivery modes, while the right side provides automated release functions using the WRCS (Weapon Release Computer Set) with possible tie-in to the navigation computer, depending on mode.  At the 11 and 12 o'clock positions are the OFF position, which is utilized for air to air weapons (including the gun) and DIRECT, which is used for video-directed weapons such as the AGM-65. The full series of positions is as follows, clockwise from the left:

+----------+---------------------------------------+

Aircraft Weapons Release Unit
-----------------------------   
     
.. image:: images/AWRU.png
  
  

Provides timed interval release scheduling of single or multiple bombs or rockets and dispensed munitions based on the selections made between the interval knob, the QTY (quantity) knob and the INTRVL switch.

The interval knob provides release pulse sequences between 0.05 second and 1 second.  

The INTRVL switch provides the option of a 10x multiplier of the set value of the interval knob.  In the NORM position, the interval knob value is the trigger timer. 
The quantity knob functions as follows:

Selecting "1" places the AWRU into single manual bombing mode; one push of the bomb release button releases one bomb.  

Selecting a value from "2" to "18" sets the AWRU into single ripple mode; in this mode, the AWRU will release bombs according to the programmed interval until the set number of rounds is dropped, or the bomb button is released.  Upon release, the count is reset, and a subsequent press and hold will drop the programmed number of bombs.

Selecting "C" sets the AWRU into single continuous mode; pressing the bomb release button drops rounds according to the programmed interval until the bomb button is released, or all munitions from the selected pylons are expended.

The "P" setting is for pairs manual mode.  With at least two stations selected, each push of the bomb button will release two bombs; like single manual mode, this does not include an interval function.

Lastly, the "S" setting, for salvo, releases bombs in accordance to the chosen interval from all selected stations simultaneously, until the bomb button is released.  Ergo, if four stations are selected with a 2 second interval (0.2 on the interval dial, X10 INTRVL switch setting), four bombs will be released every two seconds the pickle button is held down.


Missile Status Lights
---------------------

.. image:: images/MSL.png
  
  
The Missile Status Light window provides confirmation of currently installed and configured air to air missiles.

The RDR lights illuminate once AIM-7 missiles are properly tuned with the fire control system; any station that does not carry a Sparrow, does not correctly sync up during tuning, or is launched, will turn off.

The HEAT lights illuminate one at a time, rather than all up upon circuit configuration.  The light of the currently selected station will illuminate beginning at the raising of the gear handle, and remain in that position until the weapon is either cycled using the throttle's Gun/Missile Switch reject option, or is launched.


Radar Missile Power Switch
--------------------------

.. image:: images/RMPS.png
  
  
The Radar Missile Power Switch provides power to the CW tuning drive and monitoring functionality.  

When switched out of the OFF position, power is applied to the circuit 30 seconds after this selection.  

The STBY position maintains warmup power to the missiles and CW tuning drive once the missiles have been tuned.  

The CW ON position allows for constant tuning and missile state monitoring with the radar mode not in TV.  

Tuning can be performed on the ground with the radar in TEST mode to preclude emissions endangering ground crew. 


Centerline Tank Aboard Light
----------------------------

.. image:: images/CTAL.png 
  
  
Illuminates when a stores condition exists that precludes ejection and launch of an AIM-7 missile installed in one of the two forward positions.
  

Interlock Switch
----------------

.. image:: images/Intlk.png
  
A two position switch that determines whether the fire control system launch parameter interlocks can prevent an AIM-7 from being launched when the trigger is pulled.  

+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| IN          | Interlocks engaged; range limits, ASE limits, or radar not in VI inhibits launch.  |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| OUT         | Interlocks disengaged; AIM-7 will fire when trigger is pulled.                     |
+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Selective Jettison Control
--------------------------

.. image:: images/SelJet.png
  
The Selective Jettison Control knob provides the pilot direct access to dump stores in an emergency on a position by position basis, or immediate release of all single carried air to ground, MER/TER stored, or LAU-88 launcher-mounted round at once.  


+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| OFF         | Safes PUSH TO JETT button on the Selective Jettison Control Panel.                |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| STORES      | Releases all MER/TER, single carried, or LAU-88 mounted rounds upon PUSH TO JETT. |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| L/R FWD     | Jettisons AIM-7 from respective position on PUSH TO JETT.  Inhibited if CL TK ON. |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| L/R AFT     | Jettisons AIM-7 from respective position on PUSH TO JETT.                         | 
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| L/R WING    | In conjunction with TV or ARM, jettisons single AGM-65 from wing on PUSH TO JETT. |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Recorder Lamp
-------------

.. image:: images/pilot_recorder_lamp.png

This dimmable lamp is lit to indicate operation of the Airborne-Video-Tape-Recorder (AVTR).

The AVTR system is controlled by the WSO and records the intercom sound, as well as the rear radar screen.

.. _flightdg:

Flight Director Group
=====================

.. image:: images/FDG.png

 
Radar Altimeter
---------------

.. image:: images/RadAlt.png
  
  
Terrain relative accurate height information up to 5000 ft, functions to 30 degrees of bank angle or 35 degrees of pitch.  Clockwise rotation of the function control switch on the lower right of the indicator powers the device; continued rotation sets the low altitude warning pointer to the desired height. Below the set altitude, the warning light activates. A self-test, initiated by pressing the function control switch, shows 35 +-15 feet. Above 5000 feet or with unreliable signals, the pointer hides behind a mask, showing the OFF flag. The OFF flag also appears during power loss or shutdown.  
  

Airspeed and Mach Indicator
---------------------------

.. image:: images/MachInd.png
  
The combination airspeed and mach number indicator shows airspeed readings below 200 knots, and include Mach numbers at high speed.  The indicator uses a single pointer over a fixed airspeed scale, marked from 80 to 850 knots, with a moving Mach scale presenting from Mach 0.4 to 2.5. A pair of movable reference markers is available with the knob on the face of the gauge, with speed reference available between 80 and 195 knots, and the Mach index pointer being able to be set between the 225 knot and 850 knot regions relative to the airspeed gauge.  

Note: Moving these reference markers outside of the respective aforementioned regions can damage them.


Angle of Attack Indicator
-------------------------

.. image:: images/AoAInd.png

Drawing relative wind information from the landing-gear adjacent AoA probe, the AoA indicator offers conditional reference for cruise (7.9 units), approach (19.2 units), and stall (30.00).  Because of the AoA probe to the nose gear door and subsequent airflow disturbance when the gear is lowered, actual aircraft AoA is approxiamtely 1 unit higher than indicated, and ON SPEED AoA is roughly 5 knots slower than the given value.

When indicator power is offline due to electrical system configuration or damage, an OFF flag will appear in the window on the face of the gauge.  Function of the indexer lights and stall warning vibrator is driven by switches in the indicator.

Toggles between the inertial navigation set and AN/AJB-7 displacement gyroscope for attitude information. When set to PRIM, the inertial navigation set provides azimuth and attitude data to the ADI; when on STBY, AN/AJB-7 supplies this information. Azimuth data also feeds into the HSI and BDHI (rear cockpit). Additionally, attitude details are sent to the fire control system.

Note: Inertial information requires the inertial navigator control panel's switch to be on NAV.

When transitioning between STBY and PRIM, immediate attitude information may show unusual gyrations on the attitude director indicator due to initial erection. Rapid turns (above 15° per minute) may temporarily disrupt accurate heading information, requiring straight and level flight for about 20 seconds for manual compass system synchronization (SYNC position)
  

Attitude Director Indicator
---------------------------

.. image:: images/ADI.png

Includes an attitude sphere, turn indicator, steering bars, miniature aircraft, glideslope pointer, flags, and pitch trim knob. It displays pitch, bank, and heading from the selected reference system and allows pitch adjustment via the trim knob. The turn indicator relies on a gyro from the AN/AJB-7 system. The steering bars offer Flight Director guidance for heading interception, navigation, and ILS approaches. The glideslope pointer provides
vertical guidance information during an ILS approach. 
  
  
Horizontal Situation Indicator
------------------------------

.. image:: images/HSI.png
  
Consists of a rotating compass card, single and double bar bearing pointers numbered 1 and 2 respectively, a range indicator, and a range warning flag.

Standby Attitude Indicator
--------------------------

.. image:: images/StbyAtt.png
  
The SAI functions independent of the Flight Director Group, providing reasonably accurate readings (within six degrees) for 9 minutes if power to the system is lost and the OFF flag is in view.  Pitch markings are indicated every 5 degrees, while roll markings are in gradations of 10 degrees. Roll is illustrated through 360 degrees, while pitch is limited by stops at 92 degrees in climb and 78 degrees in dive to prevent gimbal lock.

Pulling the handle down extends the Tail Hook.

The hook is utilized for field emergency arrestment and not for carrier operations.


KY-28 Mode Light Panel
----------------------

.. image:: images/KY28Mode.png

Dependent on mode, the illuminated display shows P for Plain mode, or C for Cipher mode.  Note: UHF communications require the system be in Plain mode, even with system power off, barring usage and monitoring of guard channel. 


Telelight Anunciator Panel
--------------------------

.. image:: images/Telelight.png

Provides the majority of aircraft system warnings that can be rectified by the pilot.  Most warnings on the panel will cause the Master Caution to illuminate; those that do not will be noted.

Light Circuit Breakers
----------------------

.. image:: images/pilot_light_cbs.png

Hidden behind a bundle of cables to the right of the telelight panel are two circuit breakers controlling lights.

The upper one is responsible for powering the primary instrument lights, while the lower circuit breaker powers
all indicator and warning lights.

Used to extinguish telelight panel warnings and the Master Caution warning lamp once the necessary action has been taken. In the event a fault has not been effectively corrected, pressing the Master Caution Reset button will not turn the respective warning off.  


TACAN Control Panel
-------------------

.. image:: images/FrontTCN.png

The TACAN Control Panel is used to enter the desired TACAN channel, mode, and audible volume for the monitoring of said channel by the aircrew.  The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and the panel in command of the TACAN receiver is selected with the NAV CMD button of the Communication Control Panel.

On the control panel there are two Navigation Channel Control knobs, with the left controlling the first two digits of the channel value (hundreds and tens), and the right controls the single unit (ones) values.  The right knob also includes an outer ring which sets the X or Y value for the desired TACAN channel. 

Between these two knobs is the TEST button, which performs the ground testing cycle after warmup, and can also be used to perform an in-flight confidence test of the system's performance.

To the upper right, the VOL knob is available to set the desired audio level for the received TACAN station.  

The TACAN Function Selector Knob determines the presentation and type of information provided on the HSI, ADI, and BDHI, respectively.

|             | miles from the transmitting aircraft, providing this on the HSI and BDHI.         |
+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y. 


Communication Control Panel
---------------------------

.. image:: images/CCP.png

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in the aircraft.  The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat; the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority.  In the same fashion, the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its button will also illuminate on the panel of the seat that has command (control) of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat.  Close to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables receiver squelch. 

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A- auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold position (T).  

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and Preset/Manual switch.  Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2 selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz in increments of 0.025.  With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio is directly set to the displayed channel.  In the Preset position, the set channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual switch in the Preset position.  

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick functionality.  It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob.  Selecting the T position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and Indicator.  This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be changed from in the cockpit. 

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the radio system.

Cockpit Lighting Control Panel
------------------------------

.. image:: images/PilCockLights.png

The Cockpit Lighting Control Panel provides control of all panel edge lighting, flight instrument panel
lighting, the console floodlights, the white floodlights found under the canopy sill over each console,
and also includes the Warning Light Test/Standby Compass Light switch.

The White Floodlight switch acts independent of all other controls on the panel, and is either ON or OFF.
It activates a separate emergency floodlight (also called Thunderstorm Light) that illuminates the cockpit
in white. The lamp is energized through the Battery Bus to ensure it is always operational,
even in case of total power loss. Do not forget to turn off the light before parking the aircraft for a
longer time, as it will otherwise drain the battery.

The Flight Instrument Light Knob (marked INSTR PANEL), when moved to the right of the OFF detent,
controls illumination of the following six instrument lights in unison: 

* Airspeed/Mach Indicator
* Attitude Director Indicator
* Angle of Attack Indicator
* Vertical Velocity Indicator
* Altimeter
* Horizontal Situation Indicator

When in the OFF position, these indicators are independently controlled for illumation by the
knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel.

The Console Light Control Knob, with range from OFF to BRT, controls illumination level for all
panel edge lighting and the console floodlights.

The console floodlights (CONSOLE FLOOD) are triggered independently of the knob when it is
placed to the right of the OFF detent position, and offer three settings- DIM, MED, or BRT.
The floodlights will remain on until the Console Light Control knob is returned to the OFF position,
and the floodlight switch is placed in DIM. All three positions are powered by different buses to
ensure maximal availability:

+--------+-----------------------+
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus  |
+--------+-----------------------+
| Medium | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
+--------+-----------------------+
| Dim    | Left Main 115V AC Bus |
+--------+-----------------------+

The Warning Light Test Switch (Marked WARN LT TEST) is a three-position switch;
in the WARN LT TEST position, confirms function of the various emergency indicators in the cockpit.
In the STBY COMP position, it illuminates the light for the Standby Compass.
Both functions are deactivated when the switch is placed in the OFF position.

Airborne Video Tape Recorder
------------------------------

.. image:: images/pilot_avtr.png

The AVTR system is installed in the rear section to the right of the seat. It is primarily controlled by
the WSO and records the intercom sound, as well as the rear radar screen.

Footage is recorded on a standard u-matic S cassette, which can be removed and replaced using the
EJECT Button on the top right of the box. The UNTHREAD button next to it is used to unthread the tape of the
cassette back to the start, causing it to overwrite previously recorded footage.

The cassette can record up to 20 minutes, indicated on the small display labelled ELAPSED TIME.

In DCS, footage is saved in the users Saved Games folder, for example:

``C:\Users\JohnDoe\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\F-4E\recorders\avtr``

Seat
------------------------------

Seat Position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/pilot_seat_switch.png

The vertical position of the seat can be changed in either direction for about 5cm
using this springloaded switch.

Operation of the motor must be limited to 30 seconds within 10 minutes to prevent it from
overheating and breaking.

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y. 


Communication Control Panel
---------------------------

.. image:: images/CCP.png

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in the aircraft.  The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat; the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority.  In the same fashion, the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its button will also illuminate in the seat in command of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat.  Adjacent to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables receiver squelch. 

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A- auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold position (T).  

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and Preset/Manual switch.  Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2 selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz in increments of 0.025.  With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio is directly set to the displayed channel.  In the Preset position, the set channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual switch in the Preset position.  

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick functionality.  It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob.  Selecting the T position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and Indicator.  This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be changed from in the cockpit. 

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the radio system.

Target Designator Control Set
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/target_des_panel.png

This is the main panel to interact with the Pave Spike Targeting Pod.

Reticle brightness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Controls contrast of the TV reticle from black (full counter-clockwise) to green (full clockwise).
Should be set to attain maximum contrast in the display window during the designation and attack procedure.

Boresight knobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three knobs to control the boresight position of the pod in azimuth, elevation and roll within 2.5 degrees in either direction.

Azimuth and Elevation can best be calibrated in the 12-VIS mode, while roll is best calibrated in 9-VIS.

Stow Button
^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternating presses unstows and stows the Pave Spike pod head.
The head is stowed when the button is illuminated. 

When unstored, the pod will move accordingly to the selected acquistion mode.

To prevent damage to the system, the pod must be stowed during takeoff, landing and any High-G maneuvers.
Note that the stowed position is held electrically only and without power, the pod swings freely and gets damaged when forcefully bumped into its gimbal limits.


Laser Ready Select Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enables designator laser firing if illuminated after pressing.

Light remains off if interlocks (nose gear up and all pod functions working) inihibit use. Subsequent press deactivates laser system.


Power On Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Applies power to the targeting pod when pressed and released. Selected again to power off targeting pod. Button lamp will turn off once head is stowed.

To prevent damage to the system, whenever equipped, power to the system should be turned on even when not using the pod.


BIT Selector Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pressed to advance to the desired BIT mode as displayed in the adjacent window.

BIT 1 is the regular mode of the pod and must be selected for normal operations.


Light Brightness Knob
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Controls brightness of all lamps on this panel, except the Overheat lamp.


Reject/Override Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the pod detects a too huge discrepancy between the laser measured slant range and the INS based computed ranged,
it automatically rejects former and prefers latter.

In this case, the button can be used to force the use of the laser measured slant range instead.


Acquisition Mode Selector Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three position switch determining the pods main operation mode.

+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 12-VIS | Slaves LOS parallel to the optical sight pipper.                                                    |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| WRCS   | Slaves LOS to the WRCS cursors unless WRCS integration is deactivated; reverts to 12-VIS otherwise. |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9-VIS  | Slaves LOS to 90 degrees below FRL and rolled 90 degrees left.                                      |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


WRCS Out
^^^^^^^^

If lit, the WRCS is not integrated into the pod and functionalities requiring its integration are not available.

Can be pressed to manually disengage or engage integration, unless it was disintegrated by other means.


BIT Status Indicator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Illuminates based on completion of the selected BIT process; GO confirms functionality, MALF shows BIT failure for a given test cycle.


Overheat Lamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OVHT lamp illuminates to indicate an overheat condition in the pod.

To prevent damage, turn off the pod and give it some time to cool before further use.
Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging it irreparably.

To prolong use of the pod and prevent overheating, limit slow and low-level flight, as well as continuous use of the laser.
As a rule-of-thumb, do not use the laser for longer than 15 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses.
Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the pod to 30 minutes.
For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly. 

INS Out
^^^^^^^

If lit, the INS is not integrated into the pod and functionalities requiring its integration are not available.

Can be pressed to manually disengage or engage integration, unless it was disintegrated by other means.

Rudder Pedal Adjustment Crank
-----------------------------

WSO Right Console
=================

Laser Coder Control
-------------------

.. image:: images/laser_coder_control.png

The WSO can set the laser code used by the targeting pod by using the four small push-buttons on this panel.

Code Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each press will advance the corresponding digit by one.

Codes directly relate to lasers frequencies, resulting in them having to be between 1111 and 1788 and
not use digits 0 or 9 in order to be valid.

Enter Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a code has been set, it can be transferred to the Pave Spike by pressing the ENTER button to the right.

When power is applied to the system, it automatically initiates a transfer of the currently set code.

No Go Lamp
^^^^^^^^^^

Validation of an entered code takes about 5 seconds. If the NO-GO lamp is lit, the code is invalid.


Inertial Navigation Control Panel
---------------------------------

The Inertial Navigation Control Panel provides the rear pilot mode selection and system alignment command selection.

Mode Selector Switch
^^^^^^^^^

The HDG MEM-GYRO COMP switch, located under a cover, primarily stays in the GYRO COMP position for Gyro Compass type of alignment. Switching it to HDG MEM, before turning on the INS, allows, if previously stored, heading memory alignment.

+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

HEAT Lamp
^^^^^^^^^

The HEAT lamp illuminates when the system is placed into STBY mode, and remains illuminated for 110 seconds after the gyros have reached operating temperature. The system will not allow Gyrocompassing alignment if switched out of STBY before this lamp has shut off.

ALIGN Lamp
^^^^^^^^^^

The ALIGN lamp provides current INS alignment through illuminating steady (BATH alignment complete), or flashing at the completion of GYRO COMP or HDG MEM alignment.  


Weapon Delivery Panel
---------------------

ACTIVATE Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only available after the Target Insert button is pressed, placing the switch to ON provides power to the weapon release computer's circuits for a LABS release using the WRCS release range data. 


TGT FIND Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to combine the delivery functionalty of the ARBCS/LABS system with the WRCS TGT FIND mode.  NORM is selected for the standard function of the WRCS without LABS delivery capabiliby.  Selecting HOLD and an ARBCS setting from the pilot's Delivery Mode Knob provides WRCS Target Offset search capability, and the attack is completed using the normal ARBCS procedures from the IP. 


RANGE Switch
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selecting x100 changes the release range multiplier on the WRCS panel to a factor of 100; in NORM, the standard factor of 10 is applied to the release range. 


Weapon Release Computer Set (WRCS) Panel
----------------------------------------

Target Distance Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A pair of four position drum roller windows with matching analog knobs.  The top window references distances in the North-South orientation (with the first roller marked N/S), and the lower window references distances in the East-West orientation (with the first roller marked E/W).  

The rollers reference the distance shown in increments of 100 feet, thus a distance of offset in the East direction for 4000' would be entered as E0040. 

The rollers do function in an analog fashion, thus fractions of 100' can be attained by moderating the last roller accordingly; as an example, a value of 250 feet would be attained with the space between the 2 and 3 value halfway in the window in the last digit position.  


Target/IP Altitude Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A three position drum roller window with matching analog knob used to enter the altitude of either the RIP or the actual target itself, and is referenced in increments of 100'.  Fractional values can be entered as described previously.  This value can be changed once RIP or VIP is properly defined to increase release system accuracy.


Drag Coefficient Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to enter the drag coefficient value for the weapon being used from the bombing tables for the intended release mode.  This is not the stores table reference drag number.


Release Advance Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to advance the release signal given from the WRCS to the fire control system relative to the WRCS target point, in any duration from 0 to 999 miliseconds.  Also functions in conjunction with ARBCS/LABS programmed release timing.


Release Range Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to manually set bomb range in accordance with the weapon's bomb release schedule entry in the bomb tables. 


NO GO/GO Lamps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides results of the WRCS BIT tests for the selected WRCS delivery mode.  Illumination of NO GO when not in a BIT test cycle reports an INS system failure. 


WRCS BIT Knob
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A six position knob utilized to perform BIT checks against the individual WRCS delivery modes.  The BIT check is performed by selecting the desired mode for testing, pressing the knob for five seconds, then pressing the Freeze button on the Cursor Control Panel while keeping the BIT knob held down to confirm function. The result will illuminate in the NO GO/GO placard.

Volume Panel
------------

.. image:: images/wso_volume_panel.png

A small panel to the right of the antenna hand control stick contains two combined knobs to control volume.

Canopy/Low Altitude Warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sets audio level for canopy open and low altitude voice warnings.

This system is not installed on this variant of the F-4E.


Stall Warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Stall Warning knob controls the volume of the AoA tones that play when flying at certain angles.

Under certain conditions, the system can override the volume to ensure the cue is always audible in
dangerous situations.


Cursor Control Panel
--------------------

Used for WRCS radar bombing mode target entry.  Funtions only with MAP-PPI mode selected and applicable bombing mode selected on the Delivery Mode Knob.

Freeze Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used in air to ground bombing with the WRCS to initiate velocity tracking of the aircraft from the INS, as well as maintain a hold of the target position defined by the Along Track and Cross Track cursor gates, thus defining the RIP (Radar Initial Point).  The button illuminates, and remains lit, until the reset button is pressed, or another delivery mode is selected.


Target Insert Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inserts the North-South and East-West offset values entered into the WRCS control panel into the WRCS computer, performing the offset against the RIP defined by the Along Track and Cross Track cursor gates and currently tracked with the Freeze Button.  This offset inclusion performs a shift of the Along Track and Cross Track cursors to define the actual target defined by the WRCS offsets on the radar scope.  This action initiates target steering information from the WRCS to the navigational displays.


Reset Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pressing the Reset Button drops the currently tracked ground target location from WRCS computer memory, returns the Along and Cross Track cursors to their default positions, and resets the velocity tracking system values to zero. 


Along Track Wheel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to define relative range of the aircraft to the RIP, using an expanding/contracting hemisphere cursor on the radar display. This hemisphere presents true range to the target via the hemispherical PPI projection, thus allowing the RIP to be detected in an offset approach to the target.  Close approximation of range to the RIP should be prepared first with the Along Track wheel prior to using the Cross Track Wheel for best system accuracy- ie, the cursor should be placed below the intended RIP return on the radar scope, and the Cross Track wheel brought to the return point. 


Cross Track Wheel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Used to define the heading to the RIP on the radar display in PPI mode, presented as a vertical line.  The intersection of the Along Track and Cross Track cursors defines the RIP when the Freeze button is pressed.


Nuclear Stores Consent Switch
-----------------------------

Used to arm nuclear stores. In the SAFE position, release is inhibited. REL allows releasing stores unarmed, while REL/ARM allows dropping nuclear stores armed.

Aft Cockpit Lighting Control Panel
----------------------------------

.. image:: images/wso_cockpit_lighting_panel.png

The Cockpit Lighting Control Panel provides control of all panel edge lighting, flight instrument panel
lighting, the console floodlights, the white floodlights found under the canopy sill over each console,
and also includes the Warning Light Test and Standby Compass Light switch.

The White Floodlight switch acts independent of all other controls on the panel, and is either ON or OFF.
It activates a separate emergency floodlight (also called Thunderstorm Light) that illuminates the cockpit
in white. The lamp is energized through the Battery Bus to ensure it is always operational,
even in case of total power loss. Do not forget to turn off the light before parking the aircraft for a
longer time, as it will otherwise drain the battery.

The Flight Instrument Light Knob (marked INSTR PANEL), when moved to the right of the OFF detent,
controls illumination of the following six instrument lights in unison: 

* Airspeed/Mach Indicator
* Attitude Director Indicator
* Angle of Attack Indicator
* Vertical Velocity Indicator
* Altimeter
* Horizontal Situation Indicator

When in the OFF position, these indicators are independently controlled for illumation by the
knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel.

The Indexer Lights brightness knob controls relative illumination of the AoA indexers on both sides of the windscreen.
Marked positions are DIM and BRT (bright), with highest level to the right of the knob.

The Console Light Control Knob, with range from OFF to BRT, controls illumination level for all
panel edge lighting and the console floodlights.

The console floodlights (CONSOLE FLOOD) are triggered independently of the knob when it is
placed to the right of the OFF detent position, and offer three settings- DIM, MED, or BRT.
The floodlights will remain on until the Console Light Control knob is returned to the OFF position,
and the floodlight switch is placed in DIM. All three positions are powered by different buses to
ensure maximal availability:

+--------+-----------------------+
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus  |
+--------+-----------------------+
| Medium | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
+--------+-----------------------+
| Dim    | Left Main 115V AC Bus |
+--------+-----------------------+

The Warning Light Test Switch if set to the TEST position, confirms function of the various emergency indicators in the cockpit.

The STBY COMP switch illuminates the light for the Standby Compass.

Right Wall

Battery Bypass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When toggled ON, de-energizes the battery relay, disconnecting the battery from the essential 28-volt de bus and ceasing charging. Particularly used in suspected cases of thermal runaway.

Autopilot Ground Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instrument Ground Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the TEST position, connects external electrical power to the instrument buses (115/200 volt ac, 28 volt ac, and 14 volt ac) , contingent upon the generator switches being set to EXT ON.

Skyspot Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This switch would allow to select the mode of the Combat Skyspot system used for ground-directed bombing.

The system was never installed on this variant of the F-4E.

Seat Position
-------------

.. image:: images/wso_seat_switch.png

The vertical position of the seat can be changed in either direction for about 5cm
using this springloaded switch.

Operation of the motor must be limited to 30 seconds within 10 minutes to prevent it from
overheating and breaking.
