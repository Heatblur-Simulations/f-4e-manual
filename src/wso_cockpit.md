### TACAN Control Panel

![FrontTCN](img/FrontTCN.png)

The TACAN Control Panel is used to enter the desired TACAN channel, mode, and
audible volume for the monitoring of said channel by the aircrew. The panel is
duplicated in both cockpits, and the panel in command of the TACAN receiver is
selected with the NAV CMD button the Communication Control Panel.

On the control panel is found two Navigation Channel Control knobs, with the
left controlling the first two digits of the channel value (hundreds and tens),
and the right controls the single unit (ones) values. The right knob also
includes an outer ring which sets the X or Y value for the desired TACAN
channel.

Between these two knobs is the TEST button, which performs the ground testing
cycle after warmup, and can also be used to perform an in-flight confidence test
of the system's performance.

To the upper right, the VOL knob is available to set the desired audio level for
the received TACAN station.

The TACAN Function Selector Knob determines the presentation and type of
information provided on the HSI, ADI, and BDHI, respectively.

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF     | The TACAN receiver is deenergized and offline.                                                                                                             |
| REC     | The TACAN receiver is active, providing bearing information on the HSI, BDHI, and ADI.                                                                     |
| T/R     | Both the receive and transmit functions of the TACAN are active, which provide bearing and nautical mile range information for the HSI and BDHI.           |
| A/A REC | The TACAN receiver decodes bearing information from compliant aircraft for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI steering display.                                        |
| A/A TR  | The TACAN receiver receives both bearing and slant range information in nautical miles from the transmitting aircraft, providing this on the HSI and BDHI. |

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels
above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y.

### Communication Control Panel

![CCP](img/CCP.png)

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in
the aircraft. The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the
radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat;
the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority. In the same fashion,
the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its
button will also illuminate in the seat in command of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat.
Adjacent to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables
receiver squelch.

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A-
auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or
enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold
position (T).

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and
Preset/Manual switch. Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2
selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz
in increments of 0.025. With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio
is directly set to the displayed channel. In the Preset position, the set
channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position
selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the
Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored
in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels
are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual
switch in the Preset position.

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone
to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick
functionality. It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio
itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob. Selecting the T
position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD
signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function
with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and
Indicator. This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be
changed from in the cockpit.

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the
radio system.

(full clockwise). Should be set to attain maximum contrast in the display window
during the designation and attack procedure.

#### Boresight knobs

Three knobs to control the boresight position of the pod in azimuth, elevation
and roll within 2.5 degrees in either direction.

Azimuth and Elevation can best be calibrated in the 12-VIS mode, while roll is
best calibrated in 9-VIS.

#### Stow Button

Alternating presses unstows and stows the Pave Spike pod head. The head is
stowed when the button is illuminated.

When unstowed, the pod will move accordingly to the selected acquisition mode.

To prevent damage to the system, the pod must be stowed during takeoff, landing
and any High-G maneuvers. Note that the stowed position is held electrically
only and without power, the pod swings freely and gets damaged when forcefully
bumped into its gimbal limits.

#### Laser Ready Select Button

Enables designator laser firing if illuminated after pressing.

Light remains off if interlocks (nose gear up and all pod functions working)
inhibit use. Subsequent press deactivates laser system.

#### Power On Button

To prevent damage, turn off the pod and give it some time to cool before further
use. Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging it
irreparably.

To prolong use of the pod and prevent overheating, limit slow and low-level
flight, as well as continuous use of the laser. As a rule-of-thumb, do not use
the laser for longer than 15 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses.
Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the pod to 30 minutes.
For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly.

#### INS Out

If lit, the INS is not integrated into the pod and functionalities requiring its
integration are not available.

Can be pressed to manually disengage or engage integration, unless it was
disintegrated by other means.

The WSO can set the laser code used by the targeting pod by using the four small
push-buttons on this panel.

#### Code Buttons

Each press will advance the corresponding digit by one.

Codes directly relate to lasers frequencies, resulting in them having to be
between 1111 and 1788 and not use digits 0 or 9 in order to be valid.

#### Enter Button

Once a code has been set, it can be transferred to the Pave Spike by pressing
the ENTER button to the right.

When power is applied to the system, it automatically initiates a transfer of
the currently set code.

#### No Go Lamp

factor of 100; in NORM, the standard factor of 10 is applied to the release
range.

### Weapon Release Computer Set (WRCS) Panel

![wso_weapon_release_computer_set_panel](img/wso_weapon_release_computer_set_panel.png)

#### Target Distance Controls

A pair of four position drum roller windows with matching analog knobs. The top
window references distances in the North-South orientation (with the first
roller marked N/S), and the lower window references distances in the East-West
orientation (with the first roller marked E/W).

The rollers reference the distance shown in increments of 100 feet, thus a
distance of offset in the East direction for 4000' would be entered as E0040.

The rollers do function in an analog fashion, thus fractions of 100' can be
attained by moderating the last roller accordingly; as an example, a value of
250 feet would be attained with the space between the 2 and 3 value halfway in
the window in the last digit position.

#### Target/IP Altitude Control

A three position drum roller window with matching analog knob used to enter the
altitude of either the RIP or the actual target itself, and is referenced in
increments of 100'. Fractional values can be entered as described previously.
This value can be changed once RIP or VIP is properly defined to increase
release system accuracy.

#### Drag Coefficient Control

Used to enter the drag coefficient value for the weapon being used from the
bombing tables for the intended release mode. This is not the stores table
reference drag number.

#### Release Advance Control

Used to advance the release signal given from the WRCS to the fire control
system relative to the WRCS target point, in any duration from 0 to 999
milliseconds. Also functions in conjunction with ARBCS/LABS programmed release
timing.

#### Release Range Control

Used to manually set bomb range in accordance with the weapon's bomb release
schedule entry in the bomb tables.

#### NO GO/GO Lamps

Provides results of the WRCS BIT tests for the selected WRCS delivery mode.
Illumination of NO GO when not in a BIT test cycle reports an INS system
failure.

This system is not installed on this variant of the F-4E.

#### Stall Warning

The Stall Warning knob controls the volume of the AoA tones that play when
flying at certain angles.

Under certain conditions, the system can override the volume to ensure the cue
is always audible in dangerous situations.

### Cursor Control Panel

![wso_cursor_control_panel](img/wso_cursor_control_panel.png)

Used for WRCS radar bombing mode target entry. Functions only with MAP-PPI mode
selected and applicable bombing mode selected on the Delivery Mode Knob.

#### Freeze Button

Used in air to ground bombing with the WRCS to initiate velocity tracking of the
aircraft from the INS, as well as maintain a hold of the target position defined
by the Along Track and Cross Track cursor gates, thus defining the RIP (Radar
Initial Point). The button illuminates, and remains lit, until the reset button
is pressed, or another delivery mode is selected.

#### Target Insert Button

Inserts the North-South and East-West offset values entered into the WRCS
control panel into the WRCS computer, performing the offset against the RIP
defined by the Along Track and Cross Track cursor gates and currently tracked
with the Freeze Button. This offset inclusion performs a shift of the Along
Track and Cross Track cursors to define the actual target defined by the WRCS
offsets on the radar scope. This action initiates target steering information
from the WRCS to the navigational displays.

#### Reset Button

Pressing the Reset Button drops the currently tracked ground target location
from WRCS computer memory, returns the Along and Cross Track cursors to their
default positions, and resets the velocity tracking system values to zero.

#### Along Track Wheel

Used to define relative range of the aircraft to the RIP, using an
expanding/contracting hemisphere cursor on the radar display. This hemisphere
presents true range to the target via the hemispherical PPI projection, thus
allowing the RIP to be detected in an offset approach to the target. Close
approximation of range to the RIP should be prepared first with the Along Track
wheel prior to using the Cross Track Wheel for best system accuracy- ie, the
cursor should be placed below the intended RIP return on the radar scope, and
the Cross Track wheel brought to the return point.

#### Cross Track Wheel

Used to define the heading to the RIP on the radar display in PPI mode,
presented as a vertical line. The intersection of the Along Track and Cross
Track cursors defines the RIP when the Freeze button is pressed.

### Nuclear Stores Consent Switch

![wso_nuclear_stores_consent_switch](img/wso_nuclear_stores_consent_switch.png)

Used to arm nuclear stores. In the SAFE position, release is inhibited. REL
allows releasing stores unarmed, while REL/ARM allows dropping nuclear stores
armed.

### Aft Cockpit Lighting Control Panel

![wso_cockpit_lighting_panel](img/wso_cockpit_lighting_panel.png)

The Cockpit Lighting Control Panel provides control of all panel edge lighting,
flight instrument panel lighting, the console floodlights, the white floodlights
found under the canopy sill over each console, and also includes the Warning
Light Test and Standby Compass Light switch.

The White Floodlight switch acts independent of all other controls on the panel,
and is either ON or OFF. It activates a separate emergency floodlight (also
called Thunderstorm Light) that illuminates the cockpit in white. The lamp is
energized through the Battery Bus to ensure it is always operational, even in
case of total power loss. Do not forget to turn off the light before parking the
aircraft for a longer time, as it will otherwise drain the battery.

The Flight Instrument Light Knob (marked INSTR PANEL), when moved to the right
of the OFF detent, controls illumination of the following six instrument lights
in unison:

- Airspeed/Mach Indicator
- Attitude Director Indicator
- Angle of Attack Indicator
- Vertical Velocity Indicator
- Altimeter
- Horizontal Situation Indicator

When in the OFF position, these indicators are independently controlled for
illumination by the knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel.

The Indexer Lights brightness knob controls relative illumination of the AoA
indexers on both sides of the windscreen. Marked positions are DIM and BRT
(bright), with highest level to the right of the knob.

The Console Light Control Knob, with range from OFF to BRT, controls
illumination level for all panel edge lighting and the console floodlights.

The console floodlights (CONSOLE FLOOD) are triggered independently of the knob
when it is placed to the right of the OFF detent position, and offer three
settings- DIM, MED, or BRT. The floodlights will remain on until the Console
Light Control knob is returned to the OFF position, and the floodlight switch is
placed in DIM. All three positions are powered by different buses to ensure
maximal availability:

| Lamp   | Bus                   |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus  |
| Medium | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
| Dim    | Left Main 115V AC Bus |

The Warning Light Test Switch if set to the TEST position, confirms function of
the various emergency indicators in the cockpit.

The STBY COMP switch illuminates the light for the Standby Compass.

### Right Wall

![wso_right_wall](img/wso_right_wall.png)

#### Battery Bypass

When toggled ON, de-energizes the battery relay, disconnecting the battery from
the essential 28-volt de bus and ceasing charging. Particularly used in
suspected cases of thermal runaway.

#### Autopilot Ground Test

#### Instrument Ground Power

In the TEST position, connects external electrical power to the instrument buses
(115/200 volt ac, 28 volt ac, and 14 volt ac) , contingent upon the generator
switches being set to EXT ON.

#### Skyspot Mode

This switch would allow to select the mode of the Combat Skyspot system used for
ground-directed bombing.

The system was never installed on this variant of the F-4E.

### Seat Position

![wso_seat_switch](img/wso_seat_switch.png)

The vertical position of the seat can be changed in either direction for about
5cm using this spring-loaded switch.

Operation of the motor must be limited to 30 seconds within 10 minutes to
prevent it from overheating and breaking.
