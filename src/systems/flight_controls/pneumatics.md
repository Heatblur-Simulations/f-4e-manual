The pneumatic system provides power for the canopies, as well as emergency
operation for the landing gear and slats flaps systems. A Pneumatic Pressure
Indicator is found on the front cockpit [pedestal panel](../../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.md) to
confirm function, and indicates manifold pressure.
