# Radar system

![Radar Dish](../img/radar_dish_nose.jpg)

A continuation of the F-4C's -100 and the 4D's 109, the Westinghouse AN/APQ-120
Fire Control Radar is a solid state pulse radar providing the F-4E with air to
air intercept functionality, air to ground mapping, ground target reference
provision to the LABS and WRCS bombing systems, as well as radar beacon
capability. The APQ-120 also functions as the display system for TISEO and TV
guided weapon imagery, and is integrated with the APX-80 interrogation system.

The primary conversion from the APQ-109 to APQ-120 included a reduction in the
number of field replaceable units in the nose, as well as the reduction in their
size; whereas the -109 had been a hybrid in its movement towards solid state
hardware (primarily in the low voltage processing sections), the 120 was a fully
solid-state system. While this update reduced the space overhead and weight for
the system, the modification of the F-4 nose to include the
[M61 cannon](../stores/guns.md#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan) required a
reduction in antenna size, causing a marginal decrease in overall detection
range. However, when taken with the increase in system reliability and reduced
maintenance, the tradeoff was considered acceptable.

Starting with production of the F-4E block 60, and retrofitted to selected
earlier block aircraft, was the addition of the Digital Scan Converter Group
display. The inclusion of DSCG increased the overall ease of handling the
APQ-120 by adding additional information on the display directly, including
current radar range setting and the calculated range rate value against the
current acquired target. Further, clarity of the display in all lighting
conditions was improved by rendering the radar reference grids directly as part
of the displayed image, rather than the previously used markings on the DVST
glass. In addition, DSCG provided the ability of the two crew members to utilize
the displays independently; previously, the WSO had control over which mode both
the DVST and front seat repeater display would show. With DSCG, the pilot could
utilize TISEO or TV air to ground weapons while the WSO maintained a scan
pattern or found a ground reference point and inserted it into the WRCS.

## Radar set Control Panel

![wso_radar_control_panel](../img/wso_radar_set_control_panel.jpg)

### Power

![Power Knob](../img/wso_radar_power_knob.jpg)

| Name | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF  | Powers radar off.                                                                                                            |
| TEST | Applies voltage to control monitor power and provides [BIT-test](../procedures/bit_tests/overview.md) functions 1 through 6. |
| STBY | Power applied to radar, remains in a non-transmitting standby state.                                                         |
| OPR  | System is fully operational.                                                                                                 |
| EMER | Overrides the time delay, pressure, and temperature restrictions to allow radar operation.                                   |

Initial powering of the APQ-120 starts by placing the Radar Power Knob into TEST
or STBY (Standby). The warmup cycle requires 3 minutes from selecting either
setting, and confirmation of this process is shown via the Control Monitor Meter
on the Monitor Panel; after 30 seconds from cycling power, the gauge will
display a value of roughly 250Vdc; from the point the needle shows power at this
nominal value, the warmup procedure will be 2.5 minutes.

After 3 minutes, the radar can safely be placed into OPR (Operate) for
employment of the radar, BIT testing can be performed in TEST mode, or the radar
can be left in STBY for the safety of crew and others on the ground.

In the event of an emergency situation requiring immediate operation of the
radar, EMER can be selected; See the
[Magnetron and Klystron](#magnetron-and-klystron) section for more details.

### Range

![Range Knob](../img/wso_radar_range_knob.jpg)

Range control sets the range of the radar, note there are some modes where the
range settings available are restricted or forced to a specific setting.

Current Radar Set range will illuminate the respective indicator
[range lamp](../cockpit/pilot/dscg_controls.md#range-lights), as well as display
the numerical value on the DSCG display in the upper left.

![pilot_dscg_range_lights](../img/pilot_dscg_range_lights.jpg)

Values up to 50 nmi are indicated as Air-Intercept (AI) are available for
[Automatic Tracking](#track) and, 100 nmi and 200 nmi settings are available for
[Spotlight](#spotlight).

### Polarization Control

The polarization of the radio frequency energy can be changed using the
polarization control. In normal operation the LIN setting is used which produces
linearly polarized light in the vertical direction relative to the antenna, this
minimizes ground returns as many types of ground clutter are less reflective to
vertically polarized light. However because the antenna is not roll stabilized
increased return intensity may be seen when rolling the aircraft.

Both CIR 1 and CIR 2 are circularly polarized positions. Precipitation is less
reflective to circularly polarized light, so CIR 1 and CIR 2 can aid in
minimizing clutter in rain or fog.

The polarization is set using the quarter waveplate in the feedhorn which causes
the [continuous wave emissions](#klystron) to be polarized as described above.
This makes only CIR 1 compatible with launching sparrows as the sparrow rear
antenna cannot receive counterclockwise polarized light.

| Selection | Description                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LIN       | RF energy is lineally polarized in a vertical orientation. [AIM-7](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md) can be fired. |
| CIR 1     | RF energy is circularly polarized clockwise. AIM-7 can be fired.                                                |
| CIR 2     | RF energy is circularly counterclockwise. AIM-7 cannot be fired.                                                |

> ðŸ’¡ Only LIN and CIR 1 modes can be used with the Sparrow, a Sparrow launched
> using CIR 2 will not guide.

### Maneuver Switch

![Maneuver Switch](../img/wso_radar_maneuver_switch.jpg)

The maneuver switch is used to specify the tracking response to target
accelerations.

| Selection | Description                                                                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LOW G     | Default position. Limits tracking accelerations to reduce response to countermeasures and clutter. |
| HI G      | Allows track loop to respond with any acceleration.                                                |

HI G is forced when
[Computer Automatic Acquisition](#computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa) is
used.

### Scan Switch

![Bar Scan Switch](../img/wso_radar_bar_scan_switch.jpg)

The scan switch specifies the number of elevation bars used in search.

| Selection | Description                                                        | Total Vertical Coverage (degrees) |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 1 Bar     | Scans along radar plane.                                           | 6.7 (3.7 without nutation)        |
| 2 Bar     | Scan alternates between 1.875 degrees above/below the radar plane. | 10.45                             |

1 Bar Scan is automatically commanded when MAP is selected on the
[Radar Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode). For BST, AIR-GND and CAGE conditions scan
switch position is not relevant.

### Aspect

![Aspect Knob](../img/wso_radar_aspect_knob.jpg)

The aspect knob is used to provide the [Sparrow](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md)
with a simulated doppler signal when **no lock** is achieved to aid with sparrow
speed gate lock-on when sparrow is to be fired in boresight. When the radar is
tracking, the calculated (or manual if in manual) closure is used to set a
narrow sparrow speed gate +/- 150 kts around the closure for the sparrow to
search when launched.

The aspect knob also controls the display mode of the DSCG numeric output while
the radar is is in track.

See below the display and speed get settings for the various positions of the
aspect knob, with Vc indicating selected closure velocity for the speed gate,
where TAS is the aircraft true airspeed.

| Selection | DSCG Display     | Sparrow Speed Gate Setting (Vc) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| WIDE      | Closure Velocity | Entire Spectrum                 |
| NOSE      | Altitude         | TAS + 450 +/- 150 kts           |
| FWD       | Aspect           | TAS + 240 +/- 150 kts           |
| AFT       | Closure Velocity | TAS - 240 +/- 150 kts           |
| TAIL      | Heading          | 0 +/- 150 kts                   |

Closure Velocity - Displayed in knots with positive values indicating closing
and negative values indicating opening.

Altitude - Displayed in hundreds of feet (with the last digit always zero) for
example 20,000 MSL would be displayed as 200.

Aspect - Angle off the tail of the target aircraft to the shooter (own ship),
this means if the target is flying directly away is 0 degrees and directly
towards is 180 degrees. Left is shown by negative values and right by positive
values.

Heading - Heading is displayed in degrees from 000 - 360 with the last digit
always zero.

### Receiver Gain (RCVR GAIN)

![Receiver Gain Knob](../img/wso_radar_receiver_gain.jpg)

The stacked RCVR GAIN potentiometers FINE on top and COARSE on the bottom,
provide the ability to adjust the receiver gain. FINE is used for small
adjustments and COARSE is used for large adjustments. For more information see
[Gain Control](#gain-control) section.

### Track Switch

![Track Switch](../img/wso_radar_track_switch.jpg)

Track switch alters [range tracking](#range-track) settings. The default
position is AUTO which operates normal range tracking with
[Home on Jam](#home-on-jam) if jamming is detected. Home on jam can be disabled
(if jamming is erroneously detected) by setting the track switch to AOJ OUT.
Lastly if required manual range tracking can be used by setting MANUAL at which
point the [MAN Vc](#manual-vc-man-vc) knob position will be used to set the
tracking gate closure velocity.

### Display Knob

![Display Knob](../img/wso_radar_display_knob.jpg)

The DSCG can display returns in B-Scope or Plan Position Indicator (PPI)
display.

In B-Scope the horizontal axis of the display indicates azimuth, and the
vertical axis represents slant range.

In PPI the horizontal axis is distance to the left and right of the aircraft,
with the vertical axis representing distance along the track of the aircraft.

There are also two Sweep Settings NAR and WIDE, NAR is a narrow 45 degree sweep
and WIDE is a full 120 degree sweep. See [Automatic Search](#automatic-search)
for more.

The display can also be directed to provide course guidance for a Vis Ident (VI)
intercept profile against a locked target.

### Manual Vc (MAN Vc)

![Manual Vc Knob](../img/wso_radar_man_vc_knob.jpg)

The MAN Vc switch is a 12 position used to set a closure velocity for
[manual range tracking](#range-track). The 1,2 two positions counter-clockwise
set an opening velocity of 100 and 200 knots respectively. The 0 to 9 positions
clockwise set a closure velocity from 0 to 900 knots.

Closing refers to an target decreasing in range and opening refers to a target
increasing in range.

### Pulse Switch

![Pulse Switch](../img/wso_radar_pulse_switch.jpg)

The pulse switch sets the pulse and pulse repetition frequency for the radar
set. See the [Pulse Setting](#pulse-setting) for more information.

In [AIR-GRD](#air-grd-air-to-ground-position) mode and
[Computer Automatic Acquisition](#computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa), the
pulse switch is disabled automatically and SHORT pulse is commanded.

## Radar Modes (MODE)

![Mode Knob](../img/wso_radar_mode_knob.jpg)

Specific radar operating modes are dependent on the radar mode knob but also
several other conditions and switches. For a comprehensive description of the
radar operation see the [Radar Operation (General)](#radar-operation-general),
[Radar Operation (Air-To-Air)](#radar-operation-air-to-air),
[Radar Operation (Air-To-Ground)](#radar-operation-air-to-ground)

This section will briefly cover each of the positions of the radar mode knob and
link to the relevant sections below.

### BST (Boresight) Position

BST forces the radar into the [boresight](#boresight-and-cage-condition) state.
This is used when the target is spotted visually or a
[Sparrow](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md) is to be fired without radar tracking.

### RDR (Radar) Position

RDR position puts the radar in [Automatic Search](#automatic-search).

## MAP Position

MAP position is identical to the RDR position puts the radar in
[Automatic Search](#automatic-search), with the exception that nutation is
disabled and the 2 bar search pattern is not available.

### AIR GRD (Air to Ground) Position

AIR-GRD position is similar to the boresight position with the following
exceptions:

- Angle Track is Disabled while Tracking.
- Antenna is Always Fixed to the boresight with drift stabilization.

### BEACON Position

BEACON may be used with any Display Knob position other than VI, as desired.
BEACON does not display radar echos and instead listens for transponder
responses from specific beacon equipment.

### TV Position

The TV Radar Mode setting is not used on DSCG aircraft; this is superseded by
the TV display option on the DSCG panel itself, and the TV display option in the
pilot's cockpit.

> ðŸ’¡ [AIM-7](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md) missiles detune and cannot be
> re-tuned with the Radar Mode Knob in TV.

### Skin Track Lamp (SKIN TRK)

The Skin Track Lamp illuminates when an automatically achieved lock-on is
established and held by the radar. This coincides with the T symbol being lit on
the DSCG panel. A manually tracked, AOJ, or HOJ track condition will not
illuminate this lamp (or the DSCG panel T).

## FCS Control Monitor Panel

The Control Monitor Panel's primary purpose is to access the built-in
diagnostics of the APQ-120. Additionally, the panel mounts auxiliary controls
for the system - the Vc Switch and Stab Switch, and the Temp monitoring lamp.

### Coords Light

This lamp is not used with the APQ-120.

### Temp Lamp

The TEMP Lamp provides a visual indication of an overheat situation in the
APQ-120 avionics bays. Should the lamp illuminate, the radar must be powered off
immediately to preclude damaging the equipment. Should circumstances require the
radar be used during a temperature warning, the lamp should be monitored for
continued illumination, and the radar shut off as soon as possible.

### Meter Selector Knob

A sixteen-position rotary knob used in conjunction with the Meter Switch to test
various voltages, currents, and signals generated by the internals of the radar,
independently and in conjunction with the Built-In-Test system. Each position is
dual purpose, noted with two sets of values; when the Meter Switch is in the
VOLT position, the inner rim of the knob is active, delivering the specified
voltage of the selected position. In the SIGNALS position of the Meter Switch,
the outer current or signal value is tested.

### Monitor Meter

The Monitor Meter displays voltages, current, and signals relative to the
current settings of the Meter Selector knob in conjunction with the Meter
Switch, or the current Built-In Test setting.

Voltages are confirmed beginning with the -250 position of the Selector knob and
the Meter Switch in VOLT, and will indicate in the "1" region of the gauge
approximately thirty seconds after radar power-on, signifying correct voltage
delivery. After this power-up, the monitor meter will indicate in the "1" region
for nominal function if the voltages delivered are correct. The +35 selection is
an exception to this rule, as the value for correct function is 2.0 or greater.

In SIGNALS mode, the RX1-RX4 crystal current are functioning correctly with a
return in the XTAL region.

The EX1 and 2 test electrical frequency control crysals, and are also nominal
when XTAL is returned.

The magnetron, tested in MAG, long pulse operation is confirmed with a return of
1.4 to 1.8, and short pulse operation is correct with a value of 0.9 to 1.15.

KLY, which tests the CW transmitter, should find a value of 0.25 to 1.25 when
radiating correctly.

TP 1 tests the temperature and pressure interlocks, and indicates 1 when the
interlocks are closed and functioning.

TP 2 confirms waveguide pressure, and a value of 1 is correct.

In LOB, the meter needle will travel roughly between 1.5 to 2.8 as a function of
antenna nutation.  
Lastly, the LIN and CIR selectors confirm proper linear and circular pulse
performance; they only register a value of 1 for a transmission of vertical or
clockwise-rotating polarity energy. That is, they do not return a value in CIR
pulse (counter-clockwise) mode.

### APQ-120 Built-In Test Knob

Confirmation of proper system performance is performed using the various options
on the Control Monitor Panel; specific test modes are defined using the Test
Knob.

### Meter Switch

Tied to the Meter Selector knob, the two position switch defines which value of
the Meter Selector Knob is being tested - VOLT for the inner ring voltage
values, SIGNALS for the outer ring current and signal values.

### Vc Switch

With selections of 900 and 2700, the switch is used to scale the Vc gap as
displayed in F-4Es with the DVST installed, with the newer DSCG installed, the
switch must remain in the 2700 position at all times for to ensure correct
reading on the display.

### Stab Switch

The STAB switch controls the antenna pitch and roll stabilization modes. The
default NOR (normal) position maintains stabilization in both channels, and INS
system drift compensation is further applied in specific modes (AIR-GND). In
STAB OUT the stabilization of pitch, roll, and INS drift is removed from the
radar antenna. DRIFT OUT maintains pitch and roll stabilization, while removing
the INS drift compensation in modes which use it.

## Digital Scan Converter Group

The Digital Scan Converter Group (DSCG) provides an integrated display system of
the F-4E's radar and electro-optical systems. The system is composed of the
front and rear seat scopes, and is driven by the Indicator Control Unit (ICU)
which performs conversion of radar and video signals, along with the application
of information and fire control cueing symbology.

### Grid Knob

The Grid knob controls brightness of the display field grid.

### HOJ Light (H)

The HOJ light illuminates to provide indication that the radar has transitioned
to an angle tracking HOJ operation, using only memorized range and range rate
information if a jamming condition is detected.

### Scale

The Scale knob controls brightness of the angle and elevation scales surrounding
the DSCG display field.

### Track Light (T)

The Track light illuminates to confirm an angle and range-based lock-on against
a target. Same as the SKIN TRK light. See [Track](#track) for more information.

### Contrast (CONTR)

The Contrast knob controls relative DSCG display contrast.

### Range (RNG)

The Range knob controls brightness of the range cursor in PPI modes.

### Brightness (BRT)

The Brightness knob controls the brightness of the overall DSCG display.

### Offset (OFS)

The Offset knob controls brightness of the offset cursor line in PPI modes.

### DSCG Mode Knob

The DSCG Mode knob is used to select the current mode of the display.

- OFF removes all power from the display, ceasing all DSCG functionality.

- STBY (Standby) places the DSCG in its warmup mode; no display occurs during
  this process.

- DSCG TEST displays a dest field to confirm proper display function. The DSCG
  display field shows a search display with eight shades of grey to confirm
  proper operation and contrast. Prior to entry of this mode for testing, Range
  10 should be selected for correct sizing of the shaded fields.

- RDR BIT is a built-in test mode that functions in conjunction with the radar
  for calibration of the signals provided from the radar with the DSCG's ICU.

- RDR is the operational mode for use with the APQ-120.

- TV is the display mode used for EO weapons (Maverick/Pave Spike) and TISEO.

## Antenna Hand Controller

The Antenna Hand Controller is a joystick found only in the WSO cockpit on the
right console; the joystick integrates with the radar to perform range (fore and
aft) and azimuth (left and right) positional control of the acquisition symbol
on the radar display in the air-to-air modes, as well as seeker/EO sensor
direction with Maverick and Pave Spike. Additionally, the joystick includes the
Antenna Elevation Control thumbwheel, which controls the elevation angle of the
antenna, displayed via the EL strobe on the DSCG display; this elevation scan is
limited in both up and down movement to 60 degrees.

In the index finger position of the Antenna Hand Controller is the Action
Switch; a two-position switch designated half-action in the first detent, and
full-action with full engagement. In air-to- air modes, half-action initiates
visibility of the range strobe, allowing for proper range alignment with a
target return for automatic lock-on, or selection of MAN Vc rates required for a
manual lock. With proper bracketing and range strobe adjustment, full-action
attempts the automatic lock-on, or initiates manual angle tracking of the
intended target.

The interaction of half- and full-action for the
[AGM-65 Maverick](../stores/air_to_ground/missiles/maverick.md) is detailed in
the section on AGM employment.

## Range VISIDENT Indicator

The Range Indicator is used for close range VID intercept profiles, providing
range information out to two miles and range rate information from inside of
9000'. The information is confirmed as radar-accurate once the range indicator
jumps to 9. The gauge functions in the VI, B NAR, and B WIDE display modes; the
indicator does not function in air to ground modes.

## Air to Air Button

The Air to Air button is a button and a light with the primary function of
confirming entry into CAGE mode. When the crew desires to disengage CAGE mode,
the WSO can press the light (which also functions as a button) to exit CAGE mode
and revert to the current selected settings from the Radar Control Set.

## Radar Operation (General)

### Magnetron and Klystron

The magnetron and klystron are the two methods for producing radio frequency
energy in the APQ-120 radar set. Both the magnetron and klystron radiation is
fed through the antenna and emitted from the feedhorn.

#### Magnetron

The magnetron is the main radio frequency emitter for the radar. It produces
pulsed energy which is used to detect and track targets.

Magnetron emission is only present when the [Radar Power Knob](#power) is in
OPER or EMER and all interlocks described below are satisfied.

The magnetron is protected by a wave guide pressure switch and a temperature
interlock. If either of these interlocks are open (possibly because of damage or
malfunction) the [Radar Power Knob](#power) can be moved into EMER to return
operation, however operation of the magnetron without adequate pressure or
cooling, may damage the magnetron and can burn the feedhorn.

The magnetron is not powered until 3 minutes after radar turn on. This can be
overridden by moving the [Radar Power Knob](#power) into EMER, however operating
the magnetron without sufficient warm up may result in incorrect pulse width and
timing and/or degraded pulse power.

#### Klystron

The klystron produces continuous wave radio frequency energy, which is used to
tune and guide the sparrows.

The klystron emissions are present when the [Radar Power Knob](#power) is in
STBY, OPER or EMER, the
[Radar Missile Power Switch](../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.md#radar-missile-power-switch)
is in CW and all interlocks described below are satisfied.

The klystron is protected by two temperature switches, a pressure switch and a
surge current switch. If any of these interlocks (with the exception of the
surge current switch) are open the [Radar Power Knob](#power) can be moved into
EMER to return operation, however damage to the klystron and feedhorn may
result.

The klystron is not powered until 100 seconds after radar turn on. This can be
overridden by moving the [Radar Power Knob](#power) into EMER, however operating
the klystron without sufficient warm up may result in degraded power.

### Feedhorn Nutation

Feedhorn nutation is required for automatic tracking. The feed horn nutates to
rotate the radiated energy around the antenna axis. This modulates the radar
echos. Where the echo is strongest the antenna will steer if tracking, this
drives the antenna back onto a tracked target.

A side-effect of this nutation is increasing the beam-width, from 3.7 degrees
(half power) to 6.7 degrees (half power) while reducing the average intensity of
the beam.

Below describes the nutation settings for the action switch.

| Mode Knob                | Range Knob | Action Switch       | Nutation |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| RDR, BST, AIR-GND        | ALL        | Release             | Yes      |
| MAP                      | ALL        | Release             | No       |
| MAP-PPI                  | ALL        | Half or Full Action | No       |
| RDR, MAP-B, BST, AIR-GND | AI         | Half or Full Action | Yes      |
|                          | Not AI     | Half Action         | Yes      |
|                          |            | Full Action         | No       |

### Antenna Stabilization

There are three antenna stabilization modes. Two apply to
[Air-To-Air Operation](#radar-operation-air-to-air) and the other to
[Air-To-Ground Operation](#radar-operation-air-to-ground).

#### NOR

Normal operation of the antenna stabilization.

In [Automatic Search](#automatic-search) Antenna is stabilized in pitch and roll
to the horizon (radar plane). The center of the radar scan is along the heading
of the aircraft. In this mode the zero degree mark on the display indicates the
horizon.

In [Air-To-Ground Ranging](#air-to-ground-ranging) Antenna is boresighted to the
radar boresight line but stabilized in drift.

#### DRIFT OUT

The same as NOR but drift stabilization is removed.

#### STAB OUT

In [Automatic Search](#automatic-search) Antenna does not stabilize to the
horizon, but instead th aircraft reference.

In [Air-To-Ground Ranging](#air-to-ground-ranging) Antenna is boresighted to
radar boresight line without drift stabilization. In this mode the zero degree
mark on the display indicates the radar boresight line.

![antenna stabilization](../img/manual_antenna_stab.png)

### Pulse Setting

The pulse setting determines several characteristics of the radar set. These
include the length of the transmitted pulse, which amplifier is used to amplify
the signals, the frequency at which the pulses are emitted (pulse repetition
frequency).

The [Pulse Switch](#pulse-switch) controls the pulse setting. The LONG and SHORT
settings force the pulse setting into that mode. With the exception of AIR-GND,
and Automatic Acquisition which force the mode into the SHORT setting.

| Mode  | Amplifier   | Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) Setting (Hz) | Pulse Length (microseconds) |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| LONG  | Narrow Band | 370                                           | 2.0                         |
| SHORT | Back Bias   | 1060                                          | 0.4                         |

The AUTO setting enables the power-level mode switching (PLMS) described below.

#### Power Level Mode Switching

Power Level Mode Switching automatically selects the LONG or SHORT, and Narrow
Band or Back Bias, amplifiers depending on several conditions such as target
range, echo strength, noise signal.

### Gain Control

The amplification of the signals that enter the receiver is called the gain. The
gain setting is important to both search and tracking operations.

#### Manual Gain Control

The gain can be altered manually. This changes how returns are displayed. Higher
gain settings amplify all echos but can result in noise and saturation resulting
in degraded image. Lower gain settings will result in better target contrast,
however weaker returns will not be visible, this can degrade detection range.
When radar locks on the gain control is switched to the
[Automatic Gain Control Circuit](#automatic-gain-control) and manual gain
control no longer is used.

Getting the correct gain is a balance and comes with experience, as a general
rule of thumb for search the gain should be increased until a small amount of
noise (random specks) begins to show.

Along with receiver gain the display also has image levelling, after adjusting
the gain it may take a few scans for the image to adjust the level correctly.

#### Automatic Gain Control

The automatic gain control takes control of the gain setting once the radar is
in track. The gain is adjusted automatically using the target within the range
tracking gate to provide a consistent target signal for tracking.

### Sensitivity Time Control (STC)

The strength of a radar echo falls off with 1/r^4 where r is the range. This
means on a normal display the brightness of the radar returns will get dimmer
with distance. For ground mapping the APQ-120 counteracts this effect. With the
[Radar Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) in MAP and the
[Display Knob](#display-knob) in a PPI mode. Sensitivity Time Control is
enabled. This exponentially increases the receiver gain with range to counteract
the echo power fall off with range. This provides an approximately even
brightness with increasing range.

## Radar Operation (Air-To-Air)

Radar operation air-to-air includes RDR-B and MAP-B modes along with the BST
mode. RDR-B and MAP-B can be used with automatic search and BST mode can be used
as a close range mode to cue a target on the boresight.

### Automatic Search

During automatic search, the antenna moves back and forth in the radar plane.
The limits of this search are determined by the [Display Knob](#display-knob).
Search is normally 120 degrees wide with the display knob in WIDE positions, in
NAR positions the search is limited to 45 degrees wide. Only Display Knob
positions with B are usable with Air-To-Air operations.

The [Radar Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) knob is used to select automatic search
by selecting either RDR or MAP. In RDR the number of bars can be selected by the
[Scan Switch](#scan-switch). In MAP only 1 bar is used regardless of scan
switch. Feed horn nutation is used with RDR but not MAP leading to an estimated
beam-width of approximately 6.7 degrees in RDR and 3.7 degrees in MAP.

Selecting BST or AIR-GND on the Radar Mode Knob antenna scan is boresighted
along the radar boresight line.

Below shows the usual symbology present in Automatic Search and Boresight Modes.

### Acquisition

Acquisition can be used with any radar mode which uses B-Scope and is used to
achieve tracking condition.

With the [Radar Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) in RDR or MAP, Half Action can
held on the antenna hand control trigger. This begins acquisition, in RDR or MAP
the antenna azimuth will follow the acquisition symbol. In all modes where
acquisition can be used the range of the acquisition symbol will set the desired
range for lock-on.

![radar_screen](../img/radar_acq.png)

| Item | Name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Track

Automatic tracking can be commanded by first entering acquisition and then once
the target has been bracketed by the acquisition symbol Full Action can be
depressed. The radar will enter automatic track.

The type of track entered depends on the selected mode. There are two types of
tracking circuits available, angle tracking and range tracking. These will both
be described below.

![radar_screen](../img/radar_track.png)

| Item    | Name                     | Description                                                                                                   |

| b       | Allowable Steering Error | Describes Max off Angle Launch Envelope, See [Allowable Steering Error](#allowable-steering-error-ase-circle) |
| c and e | Range Strobes            | Indicates Launch Envelope, See [Range Strobes](#range-strobes) Description                                    |
| d       | Aim Dot                  | Provides pilot steering, See [Aim Dot](#aim-dot)                                                              |

In the WSO Cockpit there is an [engraved T](#track-light-t) which illuminates if
a range track condition present.

#### Angle Track

Angle tracking circuit steers the antenna to keep the target centred. It does by
making use of feedhorn nutation (conical scan). The antenna steers towards the
direction of highest amplitude in the nutation scan pattern. As a result angle
tracking cannot be achieved without nutation (MAP-B begins nutation when using
acquisition).

Angle Tracking has two settings set by the [Maneuver Switch](#maneuver-switch),
HI and LOW. These set limits on the acceleration in the angle tracking circuits.

Antenna steering has several important functions:

- Tracking Target Location in elevation and azimuth
- Providing head aiming angles to the sparrow for sparrow lock-on.
- Illuminating the target with continuous wave radio frequency energy for
  sparrow guidance.

#### Range Track

The radar uses a range gate to select a target in range. The uses only radar
returns within the range gate for its circuits. This helps eliminate clutter and
other targets, and allows angle tracking circuits to accurately track the target
of interest without erroneous signals.

In range track the range gate uses the radar echos to automatically correct any
error between the range gate and the target echo. This causes the range gate to
move, the rate at which the range gate moves is the closure velocity and
displayed on the screen, this is also used to supply the sparrow with a closure
velocity to set the sparrow speed gate for target tracking.

Range track can operate in memory mode. When in memory mode the range gate will
continue to move down at the last calculated closure velocity. When this occurs
the SKIN TRK light and T light on the DSCG will go out, the range rate digits
will begin to flash at 4 Hz. If memory mode was entered because the target was
lost the system will drop lock if the target does not reappear within 5 seconds.

Memory Mode will be Entered under several conditions:

- Manual Search is Selected ([Track Switch](#track-switch))
- Target is lost.
- Jamming condition is detected.

#### Home On Jam

The back bias amplifier in the radar produces a noise signal based on the
overall strength of the echos. Once this noise signal exceeds some threshold the
system will consider it a jamming condition and enter home on jam. The range
track circuit goes into memory mode, the angle track circuit continues to
operate and track the jamming target in elevation and azimuth.

The Home On Jam condition is also indicated by the engraved H on the DSCG and
the last zero of the closure velocity is replaced by a H along with the closure
rate flashing.

### Spotlight

In the 100 and 200 mile ranges, a procedure known as Spotlight can be used to
maintain radar monitoring of a target manually. Spotlighting entails placing the
acquisition cursor over the desired return, then selecting and holding the full
action trigger position of the Antenna Hand Controller. Doing so, the antenna
will nutate and revert to the chosen Polar switch selection to increase target
definition, but without attempting the automatic lock-on. The target can be
maintained in a well-observable state by holding full action and following the
target return with the Antenna Hand Controller until it reaches a range that
lock-on can be achieved (with the applicable change in range setting; the radar
cannot attempt a lock at an incompatible range setting).

### Intercept Computations

The LRU-1 intercept computer can calculate firing envelopes for the
[Sparrow](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md) and
[Sidewinder](../stores/air_to_air/aim_9.md) Missiles.

#### Range Strobes

The DSCG can display two range strobes at any given time representing the
missile envelope. There are three possible strobe types.

| Range Indication | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rmax             | Maximum range of the missile provided the target continues flying on current heading and course. |
| Rmax2            | Maximum range of the missile if the target performs the shortest high g turn to tail aspect.     |
| Rmin             | Minimum range capability of the missile.                                                         |

| Missile Selected | Strobes Displayed |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Sparrow          | Rmax and Rmax2    |
| Sidewinder       | Rmax and Rmin     |

All ranges are calculated for valid pilot pickle not weapon away. This means if
the missile envelope is met on the display then pickle can be pressed and
envelope will be valid for missile launch.

#### Allowable Steering Error (ASE) Circle

The allowable steering error indicates the maximum lead or lag at which the
missile can be launched and still retaining a high probability of hit. The
circle diameter gradually increases in size once Rmax is reached and gradually
begins decreasing in size as the target range approaches Rmin.

With the Sparrow selected the max ASE Circle size is 25 degrees for an AIM-7E
and 35 degrees for an AIM-7F.

With the Sidewinder selected the ASE Circle size is fixed at 1.2 degrees with
the Sidewinder caged. With the sidewinder un-caged the ASE Circle dynamically
changes size as described above, with the max diameter representing 25 degrees.

#### Aim Dot

The aim dot provides steering commands to the pilot. There are three different
types:

1. Collision Steering, this minimizes time to intercept by putting the fighter
   on an intercept course.
2. Transition steering. This begins 2 nmi outside Rmax and steers the aircraft
   towards the next steering type.
3. Lead pursuit, inside Rmax lead pursuit minimizes the missile's post-launch
   maneuvers.

![manual_radar_air_to_ground_mode](../img/aim_dot_steering.png)

#### Shoot/In Range Lights

Shoot Lights illuminate provided the following conditions are met:

- Aim Dot is Inside the ASE Circle
- Target is within Rmax and Rmin

If sparrows are selected then shoot lights are also inhibited when the target
aspect is 90 degrees +/- 9 degrees (left or right) and the target is lower than
5 degrees above the horizon. This prevents shooting a sparrow into the main lobe
clutter.

#### Hold Altitude Light

Hold Altitude Light illuminates provided the following conditions are met:

- Range is greater than the computed snap-up range.
- Altitude is greater than 32,000 ft.
- The target is more than 8000 feet above the fighter.

When the light is illuminated the azimuth error in the aim dot should be
corrected only when the light goes out the fighter should snap up to center the
aim dot.

#### Break X

In all modes (except VI) when the target is lower in range than the calculated
Rmin the Break X symbol will be displayed to indicate minimum range condition.

In Visual Intercept (VI) break X is displayed when range is less than 1000 ft.

When break X is displayed ASE Circle is also removed.

![radar_screen](../img/manual_radar_break_x.png)

### Firing Interlocks

There are several interlocks to prevent firing missiles in unfavorable
conditions.

For the Sidewinder the only interlock prevents the missile being fired with the
flaps in the down position.

For the Sparrow there are several conditions:

- The aim dot must be within the ASE Circle
- The in range and shoot lights must be on
- There must be no break X condition
- The selected mode must not be Visual Intercept

The interlocks are overridden automatically with a HOJ condition or when the
Sparrow is to be fired in boresight mode. The interlocks can be overridden
manually with the interlock switch.

### Boresight and Cage Condition

#### Boresight

Boresight can be entered either by selected [Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) to
BST or by depressing the cage switch on the throttle. The latter enters a cage
condition which is very similar to boresight entered through BST with the
exception that the cage condition limits the range to 5 nmi and forces the
manuever setting into the HI position.

When in boresight the antenna is fixed along the radar boresight line and the
radar returns are displayed on the scope as in an acquisition mode. Acquisition
can be commanded with half action as in automatic search to acquire and then
full action can be used to initiate track, range and angle tracking will begin
as normal.

[Sparrows](../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.md) can be fired without tracking the
target. Instead the pilot must position the target in the on the gunsight
pipper, the WSO can select and appropriate [aspect setting](#aspect) then
Sparrow can be fired.

#### Cage Condition

The cage condition is an close combat mode which can be entered at any time by
depressing the cage button on the pilot throttle. This by default puts the radar
into boresight as described above.

When the cage condition is present the following changes happen:

- Air-To-Air light in the rear pit illuminates.
- Trigger control is transferred to the air-to-air weapons (including when ARM
  and TV are selected)
- Optical sight switches into the A/A mode.
- Computer Automatic Acquisition becomes available.

If a track condition exists before the cage button and the pinky switch is in
radar or heat the radar breaks track and returns to boresight. If pinky switch
is in guns lock is not broken.

Cage mode can be exited from either cockpit, the pilot can place the Weapon
Select knob into or out of the B position. If the pilot leaves the Weapon Select
knob in B, it does not preclude a later entry into Cage mode. The WSO can exit
cage mode by pressing the [Air To Air Button](#air-to-air-button).

#### Computer Automatic Acquisition Mode (CAA)

Once in Cage mode, the radar can be selected in to Computer Automatic
Acquisition using the Nose Gear Steering button. In CAA, the radar enters a
vertical-oriented scan pattern 78 degrees in height by 15 degrees wide, the scan
is 3 vertical bars wide. Actual radar lock capability within this scan pattern
is from +45 degrees above the horizon line to -9 degrees below the horizon line
due to APQ software limitation. In the event that the radar finds a suitable
target within the scan volume, the target will be locked. Should the flight crew
find the locked target not be the one intended, the Nose Gear Steering button
can be pressed on either stick grip to return the radar back to the search
pattern.

In CAA mode, the radarâ€™s search pattern can be shifted left, right, center
utilizing the Pinky Switch.

| Pinky Selection | Scan Center     |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Guns            | Left (-15 deg)  |
| Heat            | Center (0 deg)  |
| Radar           | Right (+15 deg) |

![manual_caa](../img/CAA.jpg)

To exit CAA, the pilot can select position B on the Weapon Select Knob, or the
WSO can push the Air to Air button. Should a radar lock be in place at the time
of mode exit, it will be retained.

## Radar Operation (Air-To-Ground)

Radar operation air-to-ground includes the AIR-GRD mode and RDR-PPI and MAP-PPI.
AIR-GRD mode is used as a form of radar ranging for WRCS DT. RDR-PPI and MAP-PPI
are used for WRCS offset bomb and target find modes.

### Air-To-Ground Ranging

AIR-GRD mode is available when the [Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) is positioned
in the AIR-GRD position. AIR-GRD is used for air-to-ground ranging and is
available only in AI ranges. In this mode the antenna is fixed to the radar
boresight while also being stabilized in drift, this drift correction can be
removed by setting Drift Out on the [Stab Switch](#stab-switch) in-case of INS
malfunction.

AIR-GRD mode disables [Angle Track](#angle-track) operation and only uses
[Range Track](#range-track). Once locked on the main lobe clutter (ground radar
echo) will be tracked in range.

To use AIR-GRD 5 or 10 nmi range should be selected. Once the target has been
identified the pilot should make a 10 - 40 degree dive towards the target. The
receiver gain should be reduced to produce a clutter signal of approximately 1/2
nmi. This is done to prevent erroneous track of sidelobes which would result in
incorrect ranging information.

AIR-GRD Acquisition Procedure is as follows:

1. Adjust Receiver Gain to Reduce Clutter Signal to 1/2 nmi.
2. Position Range Strobe over Clutter Signal.
3. Press Action Switch to Half and Then Full Action. Release after ASE Circle is
   Visible.
4. Confirm Lock-on.

> ðŸ’¡ The radar can track ground clutter from beyond 25,000 ft however the max
> value that can be fed into the WRCS is 25,000ft.

Sometimes false tracking can occur, this can be indicated by a rapid decrease in
slant range displayed on either the optical sight or radar.

To correct this condition the following actions can be taken:

1. Press Action Switch to Half Action, Release.
2. Begin Acquisition process again.

![manual_radar_air_to_ground_mode](../img/manual_radar_air_to_ground_mode.jpg)

### Map Mode (PPI)

Radar Map mode PPI (position plan indicator) is a display which shows radar
returns plotted with their real position relative to the aircraft. The aircraft
position is at the bottom center of the display, lines parallel to the vertical
axis of the display are parallel to the aircraft track. Lines parallel to the
horizontal axis of the display are offset from the track up to a maximum of half
the current display range.

PPI Mode can be accessed by changing the [Display Knob](#display-knob) into
PPI-WIDE or PPI-NAR. With the exception of 5 nmi which is always displayed in
B-Scope interpretation.

The range cursor is an arc of constant range from the aircraft. The offset
cursor is an offset parallel to the drift of the aircraft, which can be offset
left or right of the aircraft's current track. Offset Cursor and Range Cursor
can only be displayed in PPI modes.

Both Range and Offset Cursor are displayed if
[Weapon Delivery Mode](../systems/weapon_systems/multiple_weapons_system.md#mode-selection---delivery-mode-knob)
is set to TGT FIND or OFFSET, or [Radar Mode Knob](#radar-modes-mode) is set to
BEACON. If this is not the case then only Range Cursor is displayed at a fixed
range which can be adjusted by the ground crew.

The
[Along Track Control](../cockpit/wso/right_console/center_section.md#along-track-wheel)
is used to increase and decrease the current setting for the range cursor. The
[Cross Track Control](../cockpit/wso/right_console/center_section.md#cross-track-wheel)
is used to move the offset cursor to the left and right of the aircraft's track.

![manual_radar_map_mode](../img/manual_radar_map_modes.jpg)
