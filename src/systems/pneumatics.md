The pneumatic system provides high pressure air for the
normal and emergency operation of the canopies, and the
emergency operation of the landing gear and slats flaps.
Air for the pneumatic system is drawn from the engine
bleed air supply, via the electronic equipment cooling
system, and is compressed by a hydraulic motor driven air
compressor. A pneumatic pressure sensor in the system
moisture separator opens a hydraulic shutoff valve, to
activate the air compressor, when the system pressure
falls below 2750 +50 -0 psi. When the pneumatic system
pressure builds to 3100 +100 -50 psi, the pneumatic
pressure sensor closes the hydraulic shutoff valve which
de-activates the air compressor. Normal system
pressure range is from 2650 to 3300 psi due to pressure
transmitter and pressure gage tolerances.

The pressurized air from the air compressor is
then fed into the different tanks which can
supply it to several systems:

* Canopies
* Landing gear (in emergency mode)
* Slats and flaps (in emergency mode)

A [Pneumatic Pressure Indicator](../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.md#pneumatic-pressure-indicator)
is found on the front cockpit pedestal panel.
It indicates manifold pressure of the system.
