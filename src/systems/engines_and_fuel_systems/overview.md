# Engines and Fuel System

## The engines

The F-4E Phantom II is equipped with two General Electric J79-GE-17A/F engines featuring modulated
afterburners. A turbine-type starter, powered by external air or the expanding gases of a solid
propellant cartridge, is employed for engine cranking during starting. Electrical power for the
starting process is supplied by either the aircraft battery or an external electrical power source.

## The Fuel system

The F-4E Phantom II features an internal fuel system comprising interconnected cells in the fuselage
and two internal wing tanks. External fuel can be carried in two wing-mounted 370-gallon tanks and a
600-gallon fuselage-mounted tank. Fuselage cells, arranged sequentially, included a self-sealing
feature on later aircraft. Hydraulic and electric pumps transfer fuel between cells, and engine
bleed air pressure facilitates fuel transfer.
