# Engines and Fuel System

*"This baby will go, and old Smokey will never catch it,
because it's got a state-of-the-art fuzz buster inside.
Now, it's not legal in all countries, but I'll tell you what,
Cal won't tell, no siree."*

The F-4E Phantom II is equipped with two
[General Electric J79-GE-17A/F engines](./engines.md). A turbine-type starter,
powered by external air or the expanding gases of a solid
[propellant cartridge,](./engines.md#cartridge-mode-starting) is employed for
engine cranking during starting.

It also features an internal fuel system comprising interconnected
cells in the fuselage and two internal wing tanks. External fuel can be carried
in two wing-mounted 370-gallon tanks and a 600-gallon fuselage-mounted tank.
