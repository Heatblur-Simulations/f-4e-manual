# Identification Systems

The identification system automatically responds to challenges from surface or airborne radar sets
and serves supplementary purposes such as providing momentary identification of position upon
request and transmitting a specially coded response to indicate an emergency. The system operates by
receiving coded interrogation signals and transmitting coded response signals to the source of the
challenge, with a proper reply indicating the target is friendly. Three modes of operation—Mode 1,
Mode 2, and Mode 3/A—are provided for security identification, personal identification, and traffic
identification, respectively. A fourth mode, Mode 4, is controlled through the IFF (Identification
Friend or Foe) control panel. Codes for Modes 1 and 3/A can be set in the cockpit, while the code
for Mode 2 must be set on the ground, ranging from code 0000 to code 7777.

## IFF Controls and Indicators

The Controls on the IFF control panel are shown in the following picture.

| Position | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Off      | Identification system deenergized.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| STBY     | Full Power supplied to the system but with interrogations blocked.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| LOW      | System operates with reduced sensitivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| NORM     | System operates at full sensitivity.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| EMER     | Allows the system to respond to interrogations in Modes 1,2 and 3/A. The reply for Modes1 and 2 is a special emergency signal of the codes selected on the applicable dials, while Mode 3/A replies are special emergency signals of code 7700. |

### Mode 1 Selector Switch

| ON       | Enables Mode 2 for operation.                                        |
| Out      | Disables Mode 2                                                      |

### Mode 3/A Selector Switch

The three position Mode 3/A Selector switch controls the mode 3/A operation:

| Position | Operation                                                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| M-3/A    | Self test position. Light illuminates if mode is operating properly. |
| ON       | Enables Mode 3/A for operation.                                      |
| Out      | Disables Mode 3/A                                                    |

### Mode C Selector Switch

| Position | Operation                        |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| M-C      | Self test position (Inoperative) |
| ON       | Enables Mode C for operation.    |
| Out      | Disables Mode C                  |

### Mode 1 and Mode 3/A Code selectors

The Mode 1 code selector is used to select Mode 1 codes from 00 to 73. The Mode 3/A code selector
is used to select Mode 3/A codes from 0000 to 7777.

### Mode 4 Selector Switch

The two position Mode 4 Selector switch controls the mode 4 operation:

| Position | Operation                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ON       | Enables Mode 4 for Operation.                                                                                                                                     |
| Out      | Inhibits Mode 4 from replying. If Mode 4 code is inserted, an interrogation will cause the IFF warning light and the MASTER CAUTION light to come on momentarily. |

### Mode 4 Indication Switch

The Mode 4 indication switch features positions for AUDIO, OUT, and LIGHT. In the AUDIO position, an
audio signal indicates reception of Mode 4 interrogations, and the Mode 4 REPLY light illuminates
during transmissions. In the LIGHT position, the Mode 4 REPLY light illuminates when Mode 4 replies
are transmitted, and audio is not present. In the OUT position, both light and audio indications are
inactive. To test the press-to-test Mode 4 reply indicator light, the indication switch must be in
the AUDIO or LIGHT position.

### Mode 4 Function Switch

The Mode 4 function switch has positions of ZERO, B, A, and HOLD. In the A position, the transponder
responds to Mode 4 interrogations with the same setting as set into the A position, and in the B
position, it responds to interrogations with the same code setting as set into the B position. If
the switch is in the wrong position for the code being interrogated (e.g., in A with B
interrogation), the IFF warning light and MASTER CAUTION light will not activate. Code settings for
A and B positions are inserted before flight and can be zeroed by placing the switch to ZERO. The
HOLD position is not used in flight but retains the code setting if another flight is anticipated
during the code period. Momentarily positioning the switch to HOLD after landing, waiting 15
seconds, and then turning off the IFF master switch and radar power knob retains the code with the
power off. Illumination of the IFF warning light and MASTER CAUTION light can be caused by internal
component failure, failure to respond to a valid interrogation, or a zeroized code.

### Monitor-Radiation Test Switch

This switch has three postions, RAD TEST, MON and OUT. The switch is placed to the OUT position
in-flight and not used.

### Identification of Position Switch

The Identification switch is a three position toggle switch used to provide momentary identification
of position.

| Position | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IDENT    | Allows the system to respond with identification of position replys in all modes that are being used. The response is continued for a 15 to 30 second duration after the switch is released. |
| OUT      | Disables identification of position capability.                                                                                                                                              |
| MIC      | Same as positioning the switch to IDENT, except that the UHF microphone button must be keyed.                                                                                                |

### Self Test operation

To self test Modes 2 and 3/A, place the master switch to NORM and hold the switch for the desired
test mode to the upper position. If the test light on the IFF control panel illuminates, this
indicates the mode is operating properly. Mode 1 and Mode C do not have self testing capabilities.

## Normal Operation of the IFF System

To operate the IFF system, start by rotating the master switch to STBY. After an approximate
80-second time delay, the system receives full power, but interrogations are blocked. Set the Mode
1, Mode 2, Mode 3/A, Mode 4, and Mode C switches as directed, along with the Mode 1 and Mode 3/A
code selector switches and Mode 4 function switch. Set the master switch to NORM to make the system
ready for operation on the selected modes. If the master switch is rotated from OFF directly to an
operating mode, there is an approximate 80-second time delay before the system is fully operational.

For I/P switch operation, place the I/P switch in the IDENT position or place it in the MIC position
and key the UHF microphone. The IFF system responds with special I/P signals. If the IFF warning
light and MASTER CAUTION light come on momentarily, check the Mode 4 selector switch ON and the
master switch NORMAL. Repeated illumination of the MASTER CAUTION light may be stopped only by
placing the master switch OFF, resulting in the loss of all IFF capability, or by placing the Mode 4
function switch to ZERO. Before or during flight, if the master switch is placed OFF, the IFF and
MASTER CAUTION lights will not illuminate upon interrogation. Normal IFF operation will be
available, after an 80-second warm-up, when the master switch is again placed to NORMAL. If the Mode
4 function switch is placed to ZERO, the IFF light will come on steady, and the MASTER CAUTION may
then be reset. Mode 4 will not be available during the remainder of the flight.

## Emergency Operation of the IFF System

Upon ejection from either cockpit, the IFF emergency operation automatically becomes active. If the
master switch is in the OFF position before ejection, the system will begin operation after an
approximate 80-second delay. In an emergency, rotate the master switch to EMER. The replies for
Modes 1 and 2 are special emergency signals of the codes selected on the applicable dials, while
Mode 3/A replies are special emergency signals of code 7700.
