# Flight Control System

The Flight controls chapter contains all necessary information about the tricycle landing gear of the
F-4E, the primary flight instruments as well as the different flight controls on the F-4E.

## The Flight controls

The primary flight controls of the aircraft include the stabilator, rudder, ailerons, and spoilers,
with artificial feel systems simulating aerodynamic forces for the control stick and rudder pedals.
Secondary controls consist of slats, flaps, and speed brakes. Stability augmentation is achieved
individually or in combination for pitch, roll, or yaw by engaging the PITCH, ROLL, and/or YAW stab
aug switches. The system reduces oscillations and lateral forces, enhancing overall stability. The
slats and flaps system is integrated, providing automatic slat configuration for in-flight maneuvers
and selective slat-flap configuration for takeoff and landing. Hydraulic actuation is employed, and
an emergency pneumatic system can extend flaps and slats if the normal system fails. Flap and/or
slat chatter, identified by machine-gun-like sounds and pressure fluctuations, may occur, with
emergency measures in place to prevent structural damage if they are inadvertently left extended
beyond their limits.

## The gear and ground handling

The F-4 Phantom features a tricycle landing gear system driven by the Utility hydraulic system. In
case of Utility hydraulics failure, an emergency extension system using compressed air is available
for landing gear deployment. Nose Gear Steering is controlled through a button on the control stick
in either cockpit, allowing the crew member to steer using the rudder pedals while holding the
button. The nose gear has a steering limit of 70 degrees in both directions. Additionally, the F-4E
is equipped with a Drag Chute to reduce landing roll and aid in spin recovery. Deployment is
initiated by rotating a handle in the front cockpit, and once the chute has served its purpose, it
can be jettisoned by pressing a button and pulling the handle back. This action releases the chute
cables, allowing it to pull free.
