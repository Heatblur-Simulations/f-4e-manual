[rudder](./flight_controls.md#rudder-control-system),
[ailerons](./flight_controls.md#aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems),
and [spoilers](./flight_controls.md#aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems),
with artificial feel systems simulating aerodynamic forces for the control stick and rudder pedals.
