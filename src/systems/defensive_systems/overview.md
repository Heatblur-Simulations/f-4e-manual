## Countermeasures

The F-4E features up to 4 AN/ALE-40 Countermeasure dispense Pods. The AN/ALE-40 Countermeasure
dispense Pods are used by a variety of US Aircraft and can utilize either Flares for countering
Infrared guided missiles or Chaff for breaking Radar Guidance and Radar Locks. There are several
different options for loadouts and programming of the countermeasure dispense.

## Radar Warning Receiver

The ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver (subsequently RWR) is the F-4E's passive situational awareness
system for detection of airborne and surface-to-air radar threats. The ALR-46 consists of several
passive Radar Receivers found all over the Plane as well as a computing unit and an Azimuth
Indicator. The system is also used by the B-52H.
