# Weapon Systems

Having honed your skills in navigating the Rhino through the skies, prepare for the next phase:
mastering the art of deploying ordnance with surgical precision. This chapter will teach you the
intricacies of delivering every ordinance at your disposal to the enemy. Guided by the advanced WRCS
and ARBCS, you are on the brink of achieving a level of target precision that sets a new military
standard in aerial warfare!

## Controlling the force: The multiple Weapons System

The aircraft's weapons systems avionics equipment enables both air-to-air and air-to-ground mission
capabilities. Air-to-ground systems support the deployment of various munitions, including high or
low drag bombs, guided bombs, rockets, CBU dispensers, gun pod weapons, nose guns, and combat
support equipment. The pilot has the flexibility to choose between manual (DIRECT) delivery and
several automatic delivery modes provided by computing avionics equipment. The AN/APQ-120 Radar Set
supplies air-to-ground range data for primary automatic release modes. For air-to-air missions,
available weapons include the nose gun, gun pod weapons, AIM-7 radar-guided, and AIM-9 heat-seeking
missiles. The radar set provides crucial target data for missile launches and gun operations,
enhancing accuracy and effectiveness in air-to-air engagements.

## The digital Co-Pilot: Automated Release Control System and Weapons Release Computer Set

The AN/AJB-7 ARBCS (Automated Release Control System) serves as the automated release control system
for time or pitch-relative bombing. It interfaces with Multiple Weapon Controls, Pedestal Panel
weapon settings, and various munitions such as bombs, laser-guided, or the AGM-45. The system
releases the chosen munition once the Bombing Timer or Bomb Release Angle Computer pitch angle (
gyro) target is attained. The left side of the Delivery Mode Knob on the ARBCS selects release
modes, with LOFT and T LAD modes allowing weapons release in a pull-up. LOFT entails a 4.0 G pull-up
schedule, releasing upon achieving a set gyro angle value, while T LAD assumes a 3.5 G pull-up
schedule, releasing at the end of the Bombing Timer setting. Tables provided contain necessary
values for Low and High angles, as well as the Bombing Timer.

The WRCS (AN/ASQ-91) supports various delivery modes for both level and dive maneuvers. The weapon
release signal is automatically generated by the computing system, incorporating inputs such as INS
velocities, radar target range, and manual inputs from cockpit controls. The system consists of the
ballistics computer in access door 119 and WRCS control panels in the cockpit. A flow diagram
illustrates the integration with other aircraft avionics systems supporting WRCS equipment and its
associated delivery modes. Selection of delivery modes is made through the delivery mode knob,
including LAYDOWN, DIVE LAYDOWN, OFFSET BOMB for level deliveries, and DIVE TOSS for dive
deliveries. The TGT FIND position selects a navigational mode where a release signal cannot be
obtained, serving as a SAFE (or OFF) position for weapon deployment, except for guns. The AGM-45
position activates WRCS missile mode, providing an automatic launch signal in dive, level, or pullup
maneuvers (refer to Delivery Modes, Air-to-Ground for detailed descriptions).

## Drop it your way: The Aircraft Weapons Release Unit

The AWRU (Automatic Weapon Release Unit) receives operational power when BOMBS or RKTS & DISP is
selected on the weapon selector. The control panel features two INTRVL controls and a quantity (QTY)
selector. The INTRVL controls determine the time interval between each weapon release, impacting
bomb spread and pattern length. In NORM mode, the rotary control offers intervals between 0.05 to
1.0 seconds, while in X10 mode, intervals range from 0.5 to 10 seconds. The AWRU operates in manual
or automatic mode. In manual mode, the unit produces output with each pickle signal, requiring
interruption and reapplication for subsequent outputs. In automatic mode, pulsed outputs are
generated, and the bomb button must be held to continue the pulse train. The INTRVL setting applies
exclusively to the automatic mode, dictating the time duration between the start of a pulse and the
start of the next pulse. The QTY control selects singles, pairs, and salvo release sequences,
allowing the precise configuration of the number of output pulses.
