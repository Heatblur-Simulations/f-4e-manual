# Weapon Systems

The F-4E features two systems to assist the Pilot and WSO in air-to-ground Operations. [The AN/AJB-7
ARBCS (Automated Release Control System)](./arbcs.md) serves as the automated release control system
for time or pitch-relative bombing. It interfaces
with
the [Multiple Weapon Controls,](./multiple_weapons_system.md) [Pedestal Panel](../../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.md)
weapon settings, and various munitions such
as [bombs,](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/overview.md) [laser-guided bombs,](../../stores/air_to_ground/bombs/laser_guided_bombs.md)
or the [AGM-45.](../../stores/air_to_ground/missiles/shrike.md)

The [Weapon Release CÃ³mputer Set (WRCS AN/ASQ-91)](./wrcs.md) supports
various [delivery modes](./multiple_weapons_system.md#mode-selection---delivery-mode-knob) for both
level and dive maneuvers. The weapon release signal is automatically generated by the computing
system, incorporating inputs such as [INS
velocities,](../nav_com/ins.md) [radar target range,](../radar.md) and manual inputs from cockpit
controls.

The [AWRU (Automatic Weapon Release Unit)](./awru.md) receives operational power when BOMBS or
RKTS & DISP is selected on the weapon selector. The control panel features two INTRVL controls and a
quantity (QTY) selector.
