# UHF Radio

The UHF Radio provides voice and Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) capabilities
to the F-4E. The radio can receive and transmit on 3500 manually selected
frequencies, 18 preset channels, or on the standard 243.00 MHz guard channel.
The aux receiver covers an additional 20 preset channels or guard. Two blade
antennas, one upper and one lower, as well as an ADF antenna, are provided. Once
the antenna mode is set for the primary channel, the aux receives from the other
antenna.

the radio to the other seat.
