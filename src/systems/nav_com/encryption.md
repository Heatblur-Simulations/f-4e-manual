# KY-28 Speech Security Unit

## Speech Security Unit KY-28

The UHF communication system is capable of providing either conventional or
crypto voice transmission and reception. Both UHF and intercom systems can be
used in combination with the KY-28 Speech Security Unit, if so desired in a
tactical or hostile environment. The KY-28 can either cipher outgoing voice
transmissions or decipher received voice transmissions; however, these functions
cannot be performed simultaneously. The crew can choose between plain or cipher
mode of operation. In the cipher mode operation the KY-28 converts voice inputs
through the microphone into crypto transmissions and deciphers crypto replies
that are being received to the crews headsets. In the plain mode operation the
UHF functions as a conventional voice transceiver.

## KY-28 Controls and Indicators

![KY28Mode](../../img/pilot_ky_28.jpg)

The KY-28 is controlled by the KY-28 control panel and respectively the
conventional UHF or Intercom controls. Both front and rear cockpit instrument
panels display mode lights for either mode. If the mode light P is illuminated (<num>1</num>)
the KY-28 and UHF/Intercom is operated in plain mode. If the mode light C is
illuminated (<num>2</num>) the KY-28 and UHF/intercom is operated in the cipher mode.

## KY-28 Control Panel

![wso_ky_28](../../img/wso_ky_28_control_panel.jpg)

The KY-28 control panel is in the rear cockpit. It has a power knob, a mode switch and a code
zeroize button. The power knob (<num>3</num>) provides power to the KY-28 and can be set to either
OFF, ON or
RLY (relay). The KY-28 is not powered in the OFF position. It is powered in the ON and RLY
positions. If a direct communication between KY units is desired, the ON position is to be selected.

> ðŸ’¡ RLY would provide the ability to use the KY-28 as a retransmission facility,
> which is not modeled in DCS.

The mode switch (<num>2</num>) can be set to either P (plain) or C (cipher)
operating modes. To change modes the switch has to be pulled outwards. If the
KY-28 is powered and the mode switch is set to the C position, the UHF
transmitter is automatically selected for front cockpit transmissions. Pressing
the zeroize button neutralizes the preset code in the KY-28. The zeroize button (<num>1</num>)
is guarded and should only be used in emergencies or after aircraft shutdown if
required. As the code can only be set on the ground, pressing the zeroize button
during flight makes the cipher mode inoperable for the crew for the remainder of
the flight.

> ðŸ’¡ To permit conventional UHF communications the mode must be set to P
> (plain) even if the KY-28 power knob is in the OFF position. If the mode is set
> to C (cipher), conventional UHF communication is inhibited in both the front and
> rear cockpit. An exception to this is transmission and reception on guard or aux
> receivers, as these are not affected by the cipher mode.

## KY-28 Modes of Operation

All transmitted and received signals are routed through the KY-28 unit. When the
KY-28 mode is set to P (plain), the UHF transceiver operates in the conventional
voice manner, whether the KY-28 is powered or not.

To operate the UHF transceiver in the KY-28s C (cipher) mode, the KY-28 has to
be powered. When operating in the cipher mode, the KY-28 unit functions in
either standby, receive, or transmit.

All KY-28 units remain in the STANDBY condition until either the microphone
button is actuated or a sync preamble is received. Once transmission or
reception of the crypto message has been completed the KY-28 automatically
reverts to the standby condition. While the KY-28 is in the standby condition
the radio equipment also functions as a traditional receiver as all incoming
non-crypto transmissions are passed directly to the headsets.

The unit switches to the cipher RECEIVE condition whenever a sync preamble is
received. The sync preamble is generated by other KY-8, KY-28 or KY-38 units
when the transmitting stations operator actuates the microphone switch. The sync
preamble ensures that all units in the network are in the cipher receive
condition. The enciphered message is received immediately after the sync
preamble signal and the message is decoded by the KY-28 and passed to the
aircrew headsets in the form of plain language.

When the UHF microphone switch is set to the UHF position, the KY-28 switches to
the TRANSMIT condition. The sync preamble signal is transmitted to all receiving
KY stations to switch to the cipher receive condition. After actuating the
microphone switch, a brief tone is heard in the aircrew headsets. The tone
signal indicates that the sync preamble signal has been completed and
transmitted, after which the KY-28 is ready to transmit the crews voice input.
When the mic button is released again, the KY-28 reverts to the standby
condition. The WSO must select UHF communications with the radio selector switch
to transmit ciphered messages. The UHF transmitter is automatically selected for
front cockpit transmissions if the KY-28 is operated in mode C.

> ðŸ’¡ With the C (cipher) mode selected, the transmit condition overrides the
> cipher receive condition. Hence during cipher receive operation the UHF
> microphone switch should not be actuated until the incoming message has been
> completed.
