# KY-28 Speech Security Unit

## Speech Security Unit KY-28

The UHF communication system is capable of providing either conventional or
crypto voice transmission and reception. Both UHF and intercom systems can be
used in combination with the KY-28 Speech Security Unit, if so desired in a
tactical or hostile environment. The KY-28 can either cipher outgoing voice
transmissions or decipher received voice transmissions, however these functions
cannot be performed simultaneously. The crew can choose between plain or cipher
mode of operation. In the cipher mode operation the KY-28 converts voice inputs
through the microphone into crypto transmissions and deciphers crypto replies
that are being received to the crews headsets. In the plain mode operation the
UHF functions as a conventional voice transceiver.

## KY-28 Controls and Indicators

![KY28Mode](../../img/KY28Mode.jpg)

The KY-28 is controlled by the KY-28 control panel and respectively the
conventional UHF or Intercom controls. Both front and rear cockpit instrument
panels display mode lights for either mode. If the mode light P is illuminated
the KY-28 and UHF/Intercom is operated in plain mode. If the mode light C is
illuminated the KY-28 and UHF/intercom is operated in the cipher mode.

## KY-28 Control Panel

![wso_ky_28](../../img/wso_ky_28.jpg)

The KY-28 control panel is in the rear cockpit. It has a power knob, a mode
switch and a code zeroize button. The power knob provides power to the KY-28 and
can be set to either OFF, ON or RLY (relay). The KY-28 is not powered in the OFF
position. It is powered in the ON and RLY positions. If a direct communication
between KY units is desired, the ON position is to be selected. RLY would
provide the ability to use the KY-28 as a retransmission facility, which is not
modeled in DCS. The mode switch can be set to either P (plain) or C (cipher)
operating modes. To change modes the switch has to be pulled outwards. If the
KY-28 is powered and the mode switch is set to the C position, the UHF
transmitter is automatically selected for front cockpit transmissions. Pressing
the zeroize button neutralizes the preset code in the KY-28. The zeroize button
is guarded and should only be used in emergencies or after aircraft shutdown if
required. As the code can only be set on the ground, pressing the zeroize button
during flight makes the cipher mode inoperable for the crew for the remainder of
the flight.

Note: To permit conventional UHF communications the mode must be set to P
(plain) even if the KY-28 power knob is in the OFF position. If the mode is set
to C (cipher), conventional UHF communication is inhibited in both the front and
rear cockpit. An exception to this is transmission and reception on guard or aux
receivers, as these are not affected by the cipher mode.

## KY-28 Modes of Operation

All transmitted and received signals are routed through the KY-28 unit. When the
KY-28 mode is set to P (plain), the UHF transceiver operates in the conventional
voice manner, whether the KY-28 is powered or not.

To operate the UHF transceiver in the KY-28s C (cipher) mode, the KY-28 has to
be powered. When operating in the cipher mode, the KY-28 unit functions in
either standby, receive, or transmit.

All KY-28 units remain in the STANDBY condition until either the microphone
button is actuated or a sync preamble is received. Once transmission or
reception of the crypto message has been completed the KY-28 automatically
reverts to the standby condition. While the KY-28 is in the standby condition
the radio equipment also functions as a traditional receiver as all incoming
non-crypto transmissions are passed directly to the headsets.

The unit switches to the cipher RECEIVE condition whenever a sync preamble is
received. The sync preamble is generated by other KY-8, KY-28 or KY-38 units
when the transmitting stations operator actuates the microphone button. The sync
preamble ensures that all units in the network are in the cipher receive
condition. The enciphered message is received immediately after the sync
preamble signal and the message is decoded by the KY-28 and passed to the
aircrew headsets in the form of plain language.

When the UHF microphone button is set to the UHF position, the KY-28 switches to
the TRANSMIT condition. The sync preamble signal is transmitted to all receiving
KY stations to switch to the cipher receive condition. After actuating the
microphone button, a brief tone is heard in the aircrew headsets. The tone
signal indicates that the sync preamble signal has been completed and
transmitted, after which the KY-28 is ready to transmit the crews voice input.
When the mic button is released again, the KY-28 reverts to the standby
condition. The WSO must select UHF communications with the radio selector switch
to transmit ciphered messages. The UHF transmitter is automatically selected for
front cockpit transmissions if the KY-28 is operated in mode C.

Note: With the C (cipher) mode selected, the transmit condition overrides the
cipher receive condition. Hence during cipher receive operation the UHF
microphone button should not be actuated until the incoming message has been
completed.

## KY-28 Operation

Prelaunch

1. Before applying power to the aircraft the KY-28 power knob should be in the
   OFF position and the mode switch set to P (plain).
2. Determine that a proper code has been set by personnel qualified in voice
   security equipment. In DCS and in combination with SRS (Simple Radio) this is
   done through the ground crew communication menu in the DCS communications
   menu.
3. UHF radio - ON.
4. Mode switch - P.
5. Power knob - ON.
6. If a ground test of equipment is desired, establish two-way, plain-text radio
   communications on the plain-voice radio with a suitable remote station and
   request an equipment check. (In DCS another player is needed)
7. Mode switch - C.
8. The KY-28 will perform an automatic alarm check when the mode switch is set
   to C and the power knob is set to On. The check will continue for about 2
   seconds after power is applied. During this time a steady, unbroken 1200 Hz
   tone is heard in the headsets. Upon successful completion of the check, the
   1200 Hz tone is interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate.
9. Momentarily position the microphone button to UHF to clear the interrupted
   tone. When the microphone button is released, the KY-28 reverts to the
   standby condition and is ready for either transmission or reception. If the
   until fails to pass the alarm check, the steady 1200 Hz tone continues and
   further cipher operation is inhibited.
10. Note: If the KY-28 fails the alarm check, the power knob must be set to OFF
    and the mode switch to P (plain) to enable conventional UHF communications.
11. To transmit ciphered messages, position the microphone button to UHF and
    wait until a momentary tone is heard before voice input. With the power knob
    set to ON, the momentary tone is delayed 0.5 seconds after pressing the
    microphone button. During this time an encryption check is performed and the
    sync preamble is transmitted to receiving stations. If the encryption check
    fails, a 1200 Hz tone interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate is presented in the
    headsets and cipher transmission is not possible. If the encryption check
    succeeds, a momentary tone is heard in the headsets.
12. After the momentary tone is heard, establish two-way cipher radio
    communications with a cooperating station and check for readability and
    signal strength and/or transmit your message. Upon releasing the microphone
    button the KY-28 will return into the standby condition. Simultaneous
    transmission by two or more stations on the same frequency is not possible
    and may result in garbled messages or loss of synchronization.
13. Resume normal, non-crypto communications if desired at any time by setting
    the mode switch to P (plain) again.
14. Note: The above procedures may be used to perform an in-flight check of the
    equipment.
15. Postlaunch
16. The speech security equipment shall be operated as briefed.
17. Warning: If ZEROIZE is pressed during flight, ciphered communication is not
    possible. The code can only be reset (or changed) through the ground crew
    communications menu after landing.
18. After Landing
19. Zeroize as briefed.
20. Power switch - OFF.
