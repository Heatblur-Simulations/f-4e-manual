# Navigation & Communication

Next is the intricate world of the F-4E Phantom II's navigation system â€” a critical component that
ensures precision and mastery of the skies. The navigation system in the F-4E is a sophisticated
blend of cutting-edge technology and tactical prowess. From inertial navigation to advanced
avionics, this system serves as the guiding force for pilots as they navigate the vast airspace and
execute missions with utmost accuracy.

## The encryption system

The UHF communication system in the aircraft is modified to support both crypto and conventional
voice transmission and reception. The intercom system and UHF transceiver are adapted for
operational compatibility with the KY-28 speech security unit. In tactical environments, the KY-28
collaborates with the UHF transceiver to facilitate secure voice communications for classified
traffic. The crewmember can choose between cipher and plain modes. In cipher mode, the KY-28
converts microphone inputs to crypto transmissions and deciphers crypto replies for voice inputs
to the aircrew headsets. In plain mode, the UHF radio equipment functions as a conventional
voice transceiver. The KY-28 is cryptographically intercommunicable with other KY-28 units,
KY-8 units, and KY-38 units (manpack version of KY-28). Additionally, the KY-28 has provisions
for transmitting messages via a relay facility. This function is not modelled in DCS World.
The unit contains a code assembly with mechanisms for zeroizing the codes, either mechanically or
electrically.

## The INS

The AN/ASN-63 Inertial Navigation System (INS) equips the F-4E aircrew and integrated weapons
delivery system with real-time accurate positional, velocity, attitude, and heading information.
When precisely aligned in gyrocompass mode, the INS achieves an accuracy of 3 nautical miles per
hour of circular error probability (CEP). The system features a four-gimbal inertial navigating
platform, incorporating dual roll gimbals to eliminate gimbal lock in outer roll/azimuth gimbal
alignment.

On the platform, a pair of G-200 two-axis gyros are installed, each aligned for spin on a specific
axis. Torque detection in each gyro tracks perpendicular axes, enabling representation of rotation
in all three dimensions. The gyros operate optimally at an operating temperature of 160 degrees F,
ensuring effectiveness across the Phantom's altitude operating range. Precision magnetic torquers
and accelerometers, including a tuning fork to reduce static friction, contribute to accurate
localization and velocity capture. The system's design emphasizes redundancy and climate control to
ensure reliable and precise navigation capabilities.

## The VOR/ILS and TACAN

The VHF Omnidirectional Range Instrument Landing System (VOR/ILS) furnishes accurate bearing and
course deviation information through a ground station transmitter. This system enables the aircraft
to utilize precision landing approach and descent capabilities at fields equipped with a localizer.
Pilots receive guidance information from the VOR/ILS on the Bearing Distance Heading Indicator
(BDHI), Attitude Director Indicator (ADI), and Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI). Activation of
the VOR/ILS function on these displays is facilitated through the appropriate Flight Director Group
control selections on the Bearing/Distance Selector switch, Navigation Mode Selector switch, and
Flight Director Switch.

The TACAN system offers bearing and range information to transmitting stations, with a reception
range of up to 390 miles from ground stations and 200 miles for air-to-air TACAN-equipped aircraft.
It provides the identity of the transmitting station and ensures signal dependability. Course
deviation is calculated and displayed in TACAN mode on navigation systems, with a warning displayed
in case of an invalid signal. In the event of signal loss, the system continues providing range
tracking for 15 seconds and bearing tracking for 3 seconds. Automatic signal switching between two
TACAN antennas is employed to maintain the best signal quality. Additionally, the system conducts a
self-test after a signal loss to confirm functionality on the control panel.
