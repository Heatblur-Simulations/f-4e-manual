# VOR/ILS System

The VHF omnidirectional range instrument landing system, or VOR/ILS, provides
precise bearing and course deviation information from a transmitting ground
station. Additionally, the aircraft is able to use precision landing approach
and descent capabilities at localizer equipped fields. Guidance information from
the VOR/ILS system is provided to the pilot on the BDHI, ADI, and HSI. VOR/ILS
function is enabled on these displays using the appropriate Flight Director
Group control selections on the Bearing/Distance Selector switch, the Navigation
Mode Selector switch, and the Flight Director Switch.

## VOR/ILS Control Panel

![pilot_vor_ils_panel](../../img/pilot_vor_ils_panel.png)

The control panel for the VOR/ILS is found on the front cockpit left console;
the panel includes a frequency indicator, two frequency select knobs, a volume
control (marked NAV VOL), a marker beacon volume control knob (MB VOL), and a
VOL/MRK TEST pushbutton.

### VOR/ILS Frequency Selector Knobs

The Frequency Selector Knobs is a dual actuation concentric knob; the outer ring
selects the number to the left of the decimal point on the frequency indicator,
whereas the inner knob selects numbers to the right.

### NAV VOL Knob and MB VOL Knob

The NAV VOL knob both activates the VOL/ILS system, as well as controls the
audible volume for the front cockpit. The knob is turned clockwise to power the
system on, then further to increase the volume. The MB VOL knob adjusts the
volume of the marker beacon audio in the front cockpit.

## WSO Course Indicator

In the rear cockpit is the Course Indicator, on the main instrument panel; During
an ILS approach, the indicator displays relative heading for the course set in the
course selector window, as well as horizontal and vertical position relative to 
the ILS localizer and glide slope entered by the pilot. In this way, the WSO can
assist the pilot in achieving and maintaining glide slope. The controls for the
indicator are purely for the WSOs reference, and do not interact with the Flight
Director Group displays in the front cockpit.

Components of the course indicator are a TO-FROM indicator (does not function
with ILS), a course deviation scale, a glide slope deviation scale, a COURSE
selector window, a course SET knob, a heading pointer and heading scale, a
marker beacon light, a GLIDE SLOPE indicator, a course deviation indicator (LOC
OR RANGE), and course and glide slope OFF warning flags.

Once the pilot has selected an ILS frequency, the WSO must set a course inbound
heading in the selector window using the SET knob.

Used only with the ILS system (doesn't function with VOR).
