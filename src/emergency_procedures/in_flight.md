noises, surges, etc.)
or if engine has failed

| 7. | Land as soon as practical     |    |

## DOUBLE ENGINE FAILURE DURING FLIGHT

| Step   | System/Condition        | Action               |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1. | Either engine     | AIRSTART   |
| 2. | Reference system selector    | STBY   |

If neither engine starts:

| Step   | System/Condition        | Action               |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 3. | Fuel status     | CHECK   |
| 4. | Engine master switchs    | CHECK ON   |
| 5. | Either throttle    | OFF   |
| 6. | Other engine     | AIRSTART   |
| 7. | Remaining engine     | AIRSTART   |
| 8. | If neither engine starts | Hold boost pump check switches in CHECK position while pulling left and right main fuel control circuit breakers, (H3, J1, No. 2 panel) then attempt airstart |

If neither engine can be started:

||||
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 9. | Eject     |    |

## ENGINE FIRE OR OVERHEAD DURING FLIGHT

| Step   | System/Condition        | Action               |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1. | Throttle bad engine     | IDLE   |
| 2. | If warning light goes out, fire test button     | PRESS   |
| 3. | If all FIRE/OVERHEAT lights come on when test button is pressed     | LAND AS SOON AS PRACTICAL   |

If warning light on, detection system inoperative,
trailing vapor, or fire confirmed:

||||
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 4. | Maintain 300 knots minimum, anticipate utility hydraulic failure, and avoid turns into bad engine.    |   |
| 5. | Generator bad engine     | OFF   |
| 6. | Throttle bad engine     | OFF   |
| 7. | Master switch bad engine     | OFF |
| 8. | Air refuel switch     | EXTEND |
| 9. | If fire persists     | EJECT |
| 10. | If fire ceases     | LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE |

> ðŸŸ¡ CAUTION: Do not attempt to restart the bad engine. If the
> fire ceases, and a landing is to be accomplished,
> make a single engine landing.

## COMPRESSOR STALL

| Step   | System/Condition        | Action               |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1. | Throttle     | IDLE   |

If stall does not clear:

||||
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| 2. | Generaotr switch     | OFF   |
| 3. | Throttle     | OFF   |
| 4. | Inlet ramps     | CHECK FULLY RETRACTED   |
| 5. | Ignition button     | HOLD PRESSED   |
| 6. | Throttle     | IDLE   |
| 7. | RPM, EGT, oil pressire & fuel flow     | MONITOR   |
| 8. | Generator switch     | ON   |

## GLIDE DISTANCE

With both engines failed, the aircraft will glide
approximately 6 nautical miles for each 5000 feet AGL.
The recommended glide airspeed for maximum range with
both engines out is 215 knots. This speed will allow the
windmilling engines to maintain power control hydraulic
pressures within safe limits but may not be optimum for
airstart.

## EJECTION

At ground level with wings level, canopy closed, and no
sink rate, ejection may be initiated between 0 and 550
knots if neither crewmemberâ€™s boarding weight is over 247
pounds. Boarding weight includes the crewmember and all
personal equipment with which he boards the aircraft. If
either crewmemberâ€™s boarding weight is over 247 pounds,
the minimum ejection airspeed is 50 knots. Initiate
ejection below 450 knots if possible. Although the seat is
qualified to 600 knots, ejection above 450 knots exposes the
crewmember to forces which can cause serious injury. If
airspeed is over 550 knots, minimum ejection altitude is 50
feet. In controlled level flight, eject above 2000 feet AGL
if possible. If out-of-control at or below 10,000 feet AGL,
eject.
