# Takeoff

## Normal Takeoff

The slats out-flaps down position is recommended for all
takeoffs. After taking the runway and completing
necessary pre-takeoff checks, engines can be run to 85%
with brakes held and nose gear steering engaged to ensure
nose gear alignment (figure 2-5). With both engines
operating in excess of 85% and the brakes locked, there is
a possibility of rotating the tires on the wheel rims or
skidding the tires. Check for normal rpm response and
approximate readings of 450°C EGT, 4000 pph fuel flow, ¼
nozzles, and 30-40 psi oil pressure. After releasing brakes,
advance both throttles rapidly to full military power and
check rpm, exhaust temperatures and nozzle position.
WSO check the ramps fully retracted. If an afterburner
takeoff is desired, shift the throttles into the afterburner
detent and advance full forward for max thrust. Maintain
directional control with nose gear steering or rudder as
required. The rudder becomes effective for steering at
approximately 70 knots. Wheel braking should not be used
for directional control during takeoff roll. Nose gear
steering should be disengaged when rudder steering
becomes effective. If it becomes necessary to re-engage
nose gear steering at the higher speeds, rudder pedals
should be returned to neutral prior to engagement since
rudder displacement necessary for rudder steering will
generally be excessive for nose gear steering. Sufficient aft
stick should be applied prior to nose wheel liftoff speed to
attain the desired pitch attitude. As the nose rises, pitch
attitude must be controlled to maintain a 10° to 12° (first
pitch mark) nose high attitude for aircraft fly-off. Caution
must be exercised to preclude over-rotation due to
excessive aft stick rate or an extended takeoff roll due to
late lift-off. The basic takeoff attitude should be held
during acceleration and transition to a clean
configuration. Trim change and control action during this
period are normal. The AUX AIR DOORS, WHEELS, and
MASTER CAUTION lights may illuminate momentarily
as the landing gear and flaps are retracted.

CAUTION

>Rapid full aft movement of the stick between
takeoff airspeed and 30 knots below takeoff
airspeed may result in the stabilator hitting the
runway with the possibility of stabilator actuator
damage.

## No-flap Takeoff

No-flap takeoffs are not recommended. However, if it is
determined that no-flap takeoffs must be performed to
satisfy mission requirements, aircrews should be aware
that takeoff roll and airspeed will be increased and: the
takeoff attitude will be slightly steeper. Stabilator
effectiveness is considerably increased and extreme
caution must be exercised to prevent overrotation which
could result in the stabilator striking the runway.

WARNING
>Due to increased stabilator authority with the
flaps up, aircraft rotation can be initiated at
lower than normal airspeeds and overrotation is
a definite possibility. If it appears that
overrotation is occurring, positive control
movement (stick forward) must be taken to
prevent the stabilator from contacting the
runway and/or loss of aircraft control.

## A minimum run/heavy gross weight Takeoff

A minimum run/heavy gross weight takeoff(aircraft over
55,500 pounds) is accomplished in the same manner as a
normal takeoff with the following exceptions: It is
recommended that all minimum run/heavy gross weight
takeoffs be made with afterburner. During the takeoffrun,
full aft stick must be applied prior to reaching 80 knots. As
the aircraft starts to rotate, the stick should be adjusted to
maintain 10° to 12° pitch attitude for aircraft fly-off. The
possibility of a main landing gear tire failure increases
with an extended takeoff ground run under heavy gross
weight conditions. Nose wheel liftoff speed and takeoff
speed is increased during heavy gross weight conditions.
In the event ofan aborted takeoff, it must be remembered
that stopping distance is greatly increased as abort speed
increases.

CAUTION
>With a combination of light gross weight and aft
CG, the minimum run takeoff technique (i.e., full
aft stick prior to reaching 80 knots) produces
rapid pitch rates during nose rotation. This
combination can exist when the radar package
and nose gun (or equivalent ballast) are not
installed.

## Crosswind Takeoff

Under crosswind conditions, the aircraft tends to weather
vane into the wind. The weather vaning tendency can be
easily controlled with nose gear steering. As forward speed
increases, weather vaning tendency decreases. At speeds
above 70 knots rudder effectiveness will normally be
sufficient to maintain directional control. After the nose is
lifted to takeoffattitude, the aircraft will have a tendency
to drift toward the downwind side of the runway.
Therefore, when a long time period is expected between
nose lift-off and aircraft fly-off, or when the crosswind
effect is particularly severe, nose lift-off can be delayed
accordingly. Under normal operational conditions this
action should not be required. As the aircraft leaves the
ground, it should be crabbed into the wind, wings level, to
maintain runway alignment. Takeoff in gusty crosswind
or severe wake turbulence conditions can result in an
abrupt wing low attitude at or near lift-off. When these
conditions are anticipated, use higher than computed
takeoff speed to provide additional lateral control after
lift-off.

## Climb

A simplified climb can be made by maintaining a 10° to 12°
(first pitch mark) nose high attitude until reaching 350
knots and then vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350
knots until reaching cruise Mach/TAS. Vary pitch as
necessary to maintain cruise Mach/TAS until reaching
cruise altitude. A simplified Maximum thrust climb, at
normal gross weights, can be made by maintaining a 10°
to 12° nose high attitude until reaching 350 knots and then
vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350 knots until
reaching Mach 0.9. Vary the pitch attitude as necessary to
maintain Mach 0.9 until reaching cruise altitude.

## Rig Check

A rig check shall be performed if an out-of-rig or
unintentional asymmetric load condition is suspected and
before maximu11f-performance/high-AOA maneuvering.
With all axes of the stab aug engaged, center the rear
cockpit ball and check that aircraft does not roll more than
2°/second with ailerons and spoilers trimmed neutral. Ifa
large amount of lateral trim (equivalent to more than 1
inch aileron down at 350 knots) is required to prevent roll,
an out-of-rig, malfunctioning stab aug, or asymmetrical
load condition exists. Do not maneuver at high angle of
attack if this condition exists.

## Stab Aug Check

A stab aug check shall be performed before
maximum-performance/high-AOA maneuvering. Do not
perform maximum performance maneuvers if any of the
following checks are unsatisfactory.

a. Pull nose up with 2G acceleration and release the
stick. Aircraft should stabilize in one cycle.

b. Yaw aircraft to one ball width and release rudder.
Aircraft should stabilize in one cycle.

c. Roll to 30-45° bank and release stick. Aircraft
should maintain bank angle. Roll to level flight
and release stick. Aircraft should maintain wings
level.

d. Gradually increase AOA through 11 1/2 units and
ensure slats extend together. Decrease AOA below
10 1/2 units and ensure slats retract together.
