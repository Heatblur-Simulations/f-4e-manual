# Cartridge Start

This procedure is based upon external power not being
available. During routine (other than scramble/exercise)
cartridge starts, it is advisable to use external electrical
power, if available, as this will allow use of the CNI, fire
and overheat warning circuits, and all engine instruments
during the start. If external power is used, normal
generator switching should be used. To avoid possible
irritation caused by cartridge exhaust smoke/gases, it
may be advisable to close canopies and select 100% oxygen
during start cycle.

> ðŸ”´ WARNING: Never attempt to load or unload a cartridge in
> either starter with the engine master switches on,
> ground refueling switch on, or external electrical
> power applied. If a malfunction in safety circuits
> occurs, serious injury could result.
