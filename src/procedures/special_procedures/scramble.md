# Scramble

> ðŸš§ This section is under construction.

The following scramble procedures assume that the
following actions have been completed prior to the aircraft
being placed on an alert status (subject to scramble type
activities):

* Complete preflight inspection to include a power-on
cockpit inspection, engine operational check, and
operational check of speed brakes, flaps, flight controls
and stab aug in accordance with normal BEFORE
TAXIING (FRONT COCKPIT) checks.
* INS aligned and placed in heading memory.
* Aircraft is cocked for scramble per local policy and
instructions.

If the above actions are not completed prior to scramble,
normal procedure should be used.
