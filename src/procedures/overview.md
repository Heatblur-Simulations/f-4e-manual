# Normal Procedures

This chapter contains standard procedures for operating the F-4E Phantom II.

The aircrew procedures through the
[Before Taxi](taxi.md#before-taxi)
paragraph are separated into individual
procedures for the **pilot** and **weapon system
officer**. These separate procedures allow the
individual crewmember to perform the checks
without requiring him to read the checks
performed by the other crewmember. The
remaining procedures are combined and are
coded for applicable crewmember action. Items
coded **(P-WSO)** are applicable to both the pilot
and weapon system officer. Items coded **(WSO)**
are applicable to the weapon system officer only,
and items **not coded** are applicable to the pilot
only.

> ðŸ’¡ Real procedures and checklists evolved over time.
> Ours are based on a time range
> around 80s and tailored to our Phantom specifically.
> So keep in mind that other resources
> may differ a bit in some areas.
