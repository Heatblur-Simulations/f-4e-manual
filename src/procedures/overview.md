# Normal Procedures

This chapter contains standard procedures for operating the F-4E Phantom II.

The aircrew procedures through the [Before Taxi](taxi.md#before-taxi) paragraph
are separated into individual procedures for the **pilot** and **weapon system
officer**. These separate procedures allow the individual crew-member to perform
the checks without requiring him to read the checks performed by the other
crew-member. The remaining procedures are combined and are coded for applicable
crew-member action. Items coded **(P-WSO)** are applicable to both the pilot and
weapon system officer. Items coded **(WSO)** are applicable to the weapon system
officer only, and items **not coded** are applicable to the pilot only.

> ðŸ’¡ Real procedures and checklists evolved over time. The procedures provided
> in this manual are based on a time range around the 80s and tailored to our
> simulation of the Phantom specifically. Procedures provided in other resources
> may differ slightly.

See the [Definitions](../intro/definitions.md) for an explanation of the symbology used.
