COMM function is set as GUARD/ADF, or A when the A-3-2-T switch is in A.

### True Airspeed Indicator

![TASInd](img/TASInd.png)

Provides the aircraft's true Airspeed in knots, and is calibrated from 150 to
1500 knots; airspeeds below this range are thus not reliable. At high rates of
airspeed change, there may be a lag of up to

### Flight Instrument Brightness Knob

![InstruBright](img/InstruBright.png)

Controls brightness of the flight instrument cluster.

Rotating clockwise will increase brightness of all flight instrument lights,
while at the same time dim the HSI mode and warning and caution lights, except
FIRE and OVERHEAT.

Flight instrument lights can additionally be controlled individually with knobs
on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel, located on the right wall.

### Nose/Tail Arming Switch

![NTArm](img/NTArm.png)

Controls the arming solenoids of the MER and TER racks, selecting what MER/TER
position(s) arming lanyards are pulled from released bomb fuzes upon separation,
thus making them live. This function also controls selective low/high drag
capability for retarded bombs.

| Name      | Description                                                                       |

| NOSE      | Forward and center position solenoids activate to hold arming lanyards.           |
| TAIL      | Aft position solenoids activate to hold arming lanyards.                          |
| NOSE/TAIL | Forward, center, and aft position solenoids all activate to hold arming lanyards. |

### Station Select Buttons

![SSBs](img/SSBs.png)

The Station Select Buttons are used to activate air to ground munition stations
and the nose gun. Upon selection of a station, the upper half denoting the
position will illuminate green to confirm the station is active. The lower half
will illuminate amber once the necessary mode is selected, the weapon is
compatible with the weapon select knob option, the Master Arm is in the ARM
position, and any necessary warm up period for the selected weapon type is
completed. L and R positions are left and right, respectively, with O denoting
outboard and I denoting inboard stations. The centerline weapon position is CL,
and the nose gun is armed with the GUN station selector button.

A dimmer knob is also provided to raise or lower the lighting of the station
select buttons relative to current cockpit conditions. If the Flight Instrument
Brightness Knob above it is set to the full CCW position, it overrides the
dimmer knob and Station Select Buttons are always illuminated at full
brightness.

### Master Arm Switch

![MArm](img/MArm.png)

Provides master arming function for all aircraft weapons.

### Delivery Mode Knob

![DelMode](img/DelMode.png)

The Delivery Mode Knob sets the fire control system to the desired air to ground
weapon release type. Split into two halves, the left side of the dial references
ARBCS (Altitude Reference and Bombing Computer Set) delivery modes, while the
right side provides automated release functions using the WRCS (Weapon Release
Computer Set) with possible tie-in to the navigation computer, depending on
mode. At the 11 and 12 o'clock positions are the OFF position, which is utilized
for air to air weapons (including the gun) and DIRECT, which is used for
video-directed weapons such as the AGM-65. The full series of positions is as
follows, clockwise from the left:

| Name     | Description                            |

### Weapon Selector Knob

![WSK](img/WSK.png)

Selected for the type of weapon currently required, providing release signals to
the AWRU (Aircraft Weapons Release Unit). ARM and TV positions inhibit air to
air weapon firing unless a CAGE signal is active. ARM and TV positions do not
affect tuning status of radar guided weapons. Positions are as follows:

| Name        | Description                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AGM-12      | Not used.                                                                        |
| BOMBS       | Bombs (all types).                                                               |
| RKTS & DISP | Rockets and dispensers.                                                          |
| ARM         | Anti-Radiation Missile (AGM-45).                                                 |
| TV          | Electro-optical weapons (AGM-65).                                                |
| C           | Not used; may be utilized as an OFF position.                                    |
| B           | Like AIR TO AIR switch in rear cockpit, cancels CAGE requirement.                |
| A           | Simultaneous release mode for CBU, rockets, or dispensers; bombs do not release. |

### Aircraft Weapons Release Unit

![AWRU](img/AWRU.png)

Provides timed interval release scheduling of single or multiple bombs or
rockets and dispensed munitions based on the selections made between the
interval knob, the QTY (quantity) knob and the INTRVL switch.

The interval knob provides release pulse sequences between 0.05 second and 1
second.

The INTRVL switch provides the option of a 10x multiplier of the set value of
the interval knob. In the NORM position, the interval knob value is the trigger
timer. The quantity knob functions as follows:

Selecting "1" places the AWRU into single manual bombing mode; one push of the
bomb release button releases one bomb.

Selecting a value from "2" to "18" sets the AWRU into single ripple mode; in
this mode, the AWRU will release bombs according to the programmed interval
until the set number of rounds is dropped, or the bomb button is released. Upon
release, the count is reset, and a subsequent press and hold will drop the
programmed number of bombs.

Selecting "C" sets the AWRU into single continuous mode; pressing the bomb
release button drops rounds according to the programmed interval until the bomb
button is released, or all munitions from the selected pylons are expended.

The "P" setting is for pairs manual mode. With at least two stations selected,
each push of the bomb button will release two bombs; like single manual mode,
this does not include an interval function.

Lastly, the "S" setting, for salvo, releases bombs in accordance to the chosen
interval from all selected stations simultaneously, until the bomb button is
released. Ergo, if four stations are selected with a 2 second interval (0.2 on
the interval dial, X10 INTRVL switch setting), four bombs will be released every
two seconds the pickle button is held down.

### Missile Status Lights

![MSL](img/MSL.png)

The Missile Status Light window provides confirmation of currently installed and
configured air to air missiles.

The RDR lights illuminate once AIM-7 missiles are properly tuned with the fire
control system; any station that does not carry a Sparrow, does not correctly
sync up during tuning, or is launched, will turn off.

The HEAT lights illuminate one at a time, rather than all up upon circuit
configuration. The light of the currently selected station will illuminate
beginning at the raising of the gear handle, and remain in that position until
the weapon is either cycled using the throttle's Gun/Missile Switch reject
option, or is launched.

### Radar Missile Power Switch

![RMPS](img/RMPS.png)

The Radar Missile Power Switch provides power to the CW tuning drive and
monitoring functionality.

When switched out of the OFF position, power is applied to the circuit 30
seconds after this selection.

The STBY position maintains warmup power to the missiles and CW tuning drive
once the missiles have been tuned.

The CW ON position allows for constant tuning and missile state monitoring with
the radar mode not in TV.

Tuning can be performed on the ground with the radar in TEST mode to preclude
emissions endangering ground crew.

### Centerline Tank Aboard Light

![CTAL](img/CTAL.png)

Illuminates when a stores condition exists that precludes ejection and launch of
an AIM-7 missile installed in one of the two forward positions.

### Interlock Switch

![Intlk](img/Intlk.png)

A two position switch that determines whether the fire control system launch
parameter interlocks can prevent an AIM-7 from being launched when the trigger
is pulled.

| Name | Description                                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IN   | Interlocks engaged; range limits, ASE limits, or radar not in VI inhibits launch. |
| OUT  | Interlocks disengaged; AIM-7 will fire when trigger is pulled.                    |

### Selective Jettison Control

![SelJet](img/SelJet.png)

The Selective Jettison Control knob provides the pilot direct access to dump
stores in an emergency on a position by position basis, or immediate release of
all single carried air to ground, MER/TER stored, or LAU-88 launcher-mounted
round at once.

| Name     | Description                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF      | Safes PUSH TO JETT button on the Selective Jettison Control Panel.                |
| STORES   | Releases all MER/TER, single carried, or LAU-88 mounted rounds upon PUSH TO JETT. |
| L/R FWD  | Jettisons AIM-7 from respective position on PUSH TO JETT. Inhibited if CL TK ON.  |
| L/R AFT  | Jettisons AIM-7 from respective position on PUSH TO JETT.                         |
| L/R WING | In conjunction with TV or ARM, jettisons single AGM-65 from wing on PUSH TO JETT. |

### Recorder Lamp

![pilot_recorder_lamp](img/pilot_recorder_lamp.png)

This dimmable lamp is lit to indicate operation of the
Airborne-Video-Tape-Recorder (AVTR).

The AVTR system is controlled by the WSO and records the intercom sound, as well
as the rear radar screen.

## Flight Director Group

![FDG](img/FDG.png)

### Radar Altimeter

![RadAlt](img/RadAlt.png)

Terrain relative accurate height information up to 5000 ft, functions to 30
degrees of bank angle or 35 degrees of pitch. Clockwise rotation of the function
control switch on the lower right of the indicator powers the device; continued
rotation sets the low altitude warning pointer to the desired height. Below the
set altitude, the warning light activates. A self-test, initiated by pressing
the function control switch, shows 35

### Airspeed and Mach Indicator

![MachInd](img/MachInd.png)

The combination airspeed and mach number indicator shows airspeed readings below
200 knots, and include Mach numbers at high speed. The indicator uses a single
pointer over a fixed airspeed scale, marked from 80 to 850 knots, with a moving
Mach scale presenting from Mach 0.4 to 2.5. A pair of movable reference markers
is available with the knob on the face of the gauge, with speed reference
available between 80 and 195 knots, and the Mach index pointer being able to be
set between the 225 knot and 850 knot regions relative to the airspeed gauge.

Note: Moving these reference markers outside of the respective aforementioned
regions can damage them.

### Angle of Attack Indicator

![AoAInd](img/AoAInd.png)

Drawing relative wind information from the landing-gear adjacent AoA probe, the
AoA indicator offers conditional reference for cruise (7.9 units), approach
(19.2 units), and stall (30.00). Because of the AoA probe to the nose gear door
and subsequent airflow disturbance when the gear is lowered, actual aircraft AoA
is approxiamtely 1 unit higher than indicated, and ON SPEED AoA is roughly 5
knots slower than the given value.

When indicator power is offline due to electrical system configuration or
damage, an OFF flag will appear in the window on the face of the gauge. Function
of the indexer lights and stall warning vibrator is driven by switches in the
indicator.

### Reference System Selector Switch

![RefSel](img/RefSel.png)

Toggles between the inertial navigation set and AN/AJB-7 displacement gyroscope
for attitude information. When set to PRIM, the inertial navigation set provides
azimuth and attitude data to the ADI; when on STBY, AN/AJB-7 supplies this
information. Azimuth data also feeds into the HSI and BDHI (rear cockpit).
Additionally, attitude details are sent to the fire control system.

Note: Inertial information requires the inertial navigator control panel's
switch to be on NAV.

When transitioning between STBY and PRIM, immediate attitude information may
show unusual gyrations on the attitude director indicator due to initial
erection. Rapid turns (above 15° per minute) may temporarily disrupt accurate
heading information, requiring straight and level flight for about 20 seconds
for manual compass system synchronization (SYNC position)

### Attitude Director Indicator

![ADI](img/ADI.png)

Includes an attitude sphere, turn indicator, steering bars, miniature aircraft,
glideslope pointer, flags, and pitch trim knob. It displays pitch, bank, and
heading from the selected reference system and allows pitch adjustment via the
trim knob. The turn indicator relies on a gyro from the AN/AJB-7 system. The
steering bars offer Flight Director guidance for heading interception,
navigation, and ILS approaches. The glideslope pointer provides vertical
guidance information during an ILS approach.

### Horizontal Situation Indicator

![HSI](img/HSI.png)

Consists of a rotating compass card, single and double bar bearing pointers
numbered 1 and 2 respectively, a range indicator, and a range warning flag.
Presents a top-down view of the currently programmed navigation. The Heading Set
knob is availble to input desired magnetic heading, and the Course Set knob is
used to enter VOR radial or inbound localizer course for accurate deviation
display.

### Altimeter

![Altim](img/Altim.png)

A counter-pointer style altitmeter, with thousandths in the counter window and
100 foot increments around the face. The altimeter has an absolute range of
80,000 feet. The altimeter includes a barometric scale for setting local
pressure with the knob on the indicator. Works in either electric (normal
operation mode) or pneumatic (STBY) mode, switchable via a springloaded three
position switch labelled RESET and STBY.

### Vertical Velocity Indicator

![VVI](img/VVI.png)

Provides rate of climb or descent via the static pressure system referenced in
thousands of feet per minute.

### Standby Attitude Indicator

![StbyAtt](img/StbyAtt.png)

The SAI functions independent of the Flight Director Group, providing reasonably
accurate readings (within six degrees) for 9 minutes if power to the system is

above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y.

### Communication Control Panel

![CCP](img/CCP.png)

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in
the aircraft. The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the
radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat;
the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority. In the same fashion,
the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its
button will also illuminate on the panel of the seat that has command (control)
of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat. Close
to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables receiver
squelch.

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A-
auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or
enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold
position (T).

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and
Preset/Manual switch. Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2
selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz
in increments of 0.025. With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio
is directly set to the displayed channel. In the Preset position, the set
channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position
selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the
Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored
in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels
are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual
switch in the Preset position.

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone
to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick
functionality. It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio
itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob. Selecting the T
position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD
signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function
with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and
Indicator. This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be
changed from in the cockpit.

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the
radio system.

- Horizontal Situation Indicator

The base intensity of all indicators is controlled with the Flight Instrument
Light knob on the Cockpit Light Control Panel.

### Formation and Indexer Lights Control Panel

![FormLights](img/FormLights.png)

Control of the formation lights, which are found on the wing tips, both sides of
the vertical stabilizer, and along the fuselage forward and amidship, is
performed using the three position switch and rotary knob on this panel. The
switch has positions for MOM (momentary), OFF, and ON. The variable control knob
provides relative illumination levels at five positions: OFF, DIM, MED (medium),
BRT (bright), and JOIN UP.

Also on this panel is the Indexer Lights brightness knob, which controls
relative illumination of the AoA indexers on both sides of the windscreen.
Marked positions are DIM and BRT (bright), with highest level to the right of
the knob.

### Circuit Breaker Panel

If a circuit breaker is popped, the corresponding system does not receive power
and cannot be operated anymore.

### Emergency Floodlights Panel

![PilFlood](img/PilFlood.png)

This auxiliary panel has various controls for lights and also audio.

#### Stall Warning

The Stall Warning knob controls the volume of the AoA tones that play when
flying at certain angles.

Under certain conditions, the system can override the volume to ensure the cue
is always audible in dangerous situations.

#### Standby AI

This knob used to control the brightness of the Standby Attitude Indicator (SAI)
lights, but has been replaced by the SAI Panel on the left wall.

#### Instrument Flood

The three position switch controls the lamps illuminating the instrument panels
in both cockpits simultaneously in red light.

The bright and dim positions activate lamps powered by different electrical
buses to ensure the emergency light is available even in case of failure.

| Lamp   | Bus                  |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus |
| Dim    | Left Main 14V AC Bus |

#### ML Audio

Controls the volume of the Missile Launch System that plays tones to warn the
pilot about being under attack.

### IFF Control Panel

![IFF](img/IFF.png)

### DCU-94A Stores Control-Monitor Panel

![DCU94](img/DCU94.png)

This panel is used to control and test the separate release circuit system for
nuclear stores.

Nuclear stores are separated from the regular release system to prevent
accidental release.

### Compass Control Panel

![CompassCtl](img/CompassCtl.png)

Manages essential controls for the proper operation of the AJB-7 azimuth system.
Essencial for accurate azimuth output to instruments like ADI, HSI, BDHI, but
also to the rear seat attitude indicator, autopilot, and bombing computer.

#### Mode Selector Knob

Switches between different operating modes — Compass, DG (directional gyro), and
Slaved. It also has a spring-loaded SYNC position for fast synchronization of the
azimuth system basen on the compass flux valve signal.

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMP (Compass)        | Used in emergencies when the reference systems fail. Supplies magnetic heading directly from the flux valve                                                                                                                  |
| DG (Directional Gyro) | Used in extreme latitudes and regions with magnetic distortion, the initial magnetic heading needs manual adjustment. If the reference system is set to STBY, the aircraft's latitude must be adjusted on the latitude knob. |
| Slaved                | Primary operational mode under typical conditions, it depends on signals from the flux valve for a gradual synchronization of the system.                                                                                    |
| SYNC                  | Spring-loaded to return to SLAVED, facilitates fast synchronization between the compass flux valve and azimuth reference.                                                                                                    |

#### Hemisphere Switch and Latitude Control Knob

Adjusted to set the aircraft's hemisphere and latitude in the DG Compass System
mode, when operating with the STBY reference system. The hemisphere is
determined by rotating the screw above the latitude knob. When the PRIM
reference system mode is active, setting a latitude other than zero will cause
errors by doubling drift compensation due to INS corrections.

#### Set Heading Control Knob

Push-to-turn knob, spring-loaded to return to the center, permits manual
adjustment of the azimuth, crucial when operating in the DG mode.

#### Sync Indicator

Displays the azimuth deviation between the flux valve signal and the internal
reference system.

### Exterior Lights Control Panel

![ExtLights](img/ExtLights.png)

This panel contains controls connected to most of the exterior lighting:

- 3 position lights (green, red, white)
- 2 wingtip join-up lights (green, red)
- 3 fuselage lights (white)
- anti-collision tail light with 2 lamps (red)

Three switches labelled Fuselage, Tail and Wing control brightness of the lights
between BRT (Bright), DIM and OFF.

To ensure lights are available even in case of power failure conditions, the BRT
and DIM selections are routed through different buses:

| Lamp       | Bus                   |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Bright     | Right Main 28V DC Bus |
| Dim        | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
| Anti-Col 1 | Right Main 14V AC Bus |
| Anti-Col 2 | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |

#### Fuselage Switch

Controls the three white fuselage lights.

Additionally, if set to BRT and and the Flasher Switch is set to FLASH, both
anti-collision lights illuminate.

#### Tail Switch

Controls the position light on the tail.

#### Wing Switch

Controls two of the three position and the two join-up lights on the wingtips.

#### Flasher Switch

Can be set to OFF, STEADY or FLASH to additionally control the setting for:

- one of the two anti-collision lamps
- tail position light
- fuselage lights

If set to OFF, the controlled lights are OFF regardless of their respective
switches. In the STEADY position, they light up corresponding to the selected
brightness. The FLASH position lets the controlled lights phase from the set
brightness to a low brigthness and back.

### Emergency Vent Handle

![EmergVent](img/EmergVent.png)

A plug that can be pulled to release cockpit pressure. Putting it back in will
seal the cabin again.

Should only be used if the pressurization system is malfunctioning and reads
abnormal values. Descend to safe altitudes before activating.

### Utility Panel (Right)

### Temperature Control

![PilTemp](img/PilTemp.png)

Used to adjust ECS system for pilot comfort.

### Cockpit Lighting Control Panel

![PilCockLights](img/PilCockLights.png)

The Cockpit Lighting Control Panel provides control of all panel edge lighting,
flight instrument panel lighting, the console floodlights, the white floodlights
found under the canopy sill over each console, and also includes the Warning
Light Test/Standby Compass Light switch.

The White Floodlight switch acts independent of all other controls on the panel,
and is either ON or OFF. It activates a separate emergency floodlight (also
called Thunderstorm Light) that illuminates the cockpit in white. The lamp is
energized through the Battery Bus to ensure it is always operational, even in
case of total power loss. Do not forget to turn off the light before parking the
aircraft for a longer time, as it will otherwise drain the battery.

The Flight Instrument Light Knob (marked INSTR PANEL), when moved to the right
of the OFF detent, controls illumination of the following six instrument lights
in unison:

- Airspeed/Mach Indicator
- Attitude Director Indicator
- Angle of Attack Indicator
- Vertical Velocity Indicator
- Altimeter
- Horizontal Situation Indicator

When in the OFF position, these indicators are independently controlled for
illumation by the knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel.

The Console Light Control Knob, with range from OFF to BRT, controls
illumination level for all panel edge lighting and the console floodlights.

The console floodlights (CONSOLE FLOOD) are triggered independently of the knob
when it is placed to the right of the OFF detent position, and offer three
settings- DIM, MED, or BRT. The floodlights will remain on until the Console
Light Control knob is returned to the OFF position, and the floodlight switch is
placed in DIM. All three positions are powered by different buses to ensure
maximal availability:

| Lamp   | Bus                   |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus  |
| Medium | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
| Dim    | Left Main 115V AC Bus |

The Warning Light Test Switch (Marked WARN LT TEST) is a three-position switch;
in the WARN LT TEST position, confirms function of the various emergency
indicators in the cockpit. In the STBY COMP position, it illuminates the light
for the Standby Compass. Both functions are deactivated when the switch is
placed in the OFF position.

### Airborne Video Tape Recorder

![pilot_avtr](img/pilot_avtr.png)

The AVTR system is installed in the rear section to the right of the seat. It is
primarily controlled by the WSO and records the intercom sound, as well as the
rear radar screen.

Footage is recorded on a standard u-matic S cassette, which can be removed and
replaced using the EJECT Button on the top right of the box. The UNTHREAD button
next to it is used to unthread the tape of the cassette back to the start,
causing it to overwrite previously recorded footage.

The cassette can record up to 20 minutes, indicated on the small display
labelled ELAPSED TIME.

In DCS, footage is saved in the users Saved Games folder, for example:

`C:\Users\JohnDoe\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\F-4E\recorders\avtr`

### Seat

#### Seat Position

![pilot_seat_switch](img/pilot_seat_switch.png)

The vertical position of the seat can be changed in either direction for about
5cm using this spring-loaded switch.

Operation of the motor must be limited to 30 seconds within 10 minutes to
prevent it from overheating and breaking.
