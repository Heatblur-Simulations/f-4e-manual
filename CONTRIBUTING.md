# Welcome to the project ![pog](https://i.imgur.com/88HGDD0.png)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our manual! üéâ

The F-4E Manual is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions
from our community ‚Äî **you**!

There are many ways to contribute, from adding a new procedure, improving the a
section, spotting typos or also simply adding a new image.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Legal yada yada

The manual is published under the [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en).
Please make sure you understand its terms.

Additionally, by submitting a PR and contributing to the project, you transfer the rights you
hold to your own contribution to Heatblur Simulations. That is, Heatblur Simulations is free to use
the content you created under the terms of the above license.

## Ground Rules

- Create [issues](https://github.com/Heatblur-Simulations/f-4e-manual/issues)
  for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make, as well as for
  reporting any sort of bugs. For more light-hearted talks, you can use
  [discussions](https://github.com/Heatblur-Simulations/f-4e-manual/discussions).
  Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all
  backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to the manual? You can start by looking
through these labels!

- [good first issue](https://github.com/Heatblur-Simulations/f-4e-manual/issues/?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) -
  issues which should only require a few minor changes.

Let us know that you intend to work on the issue by commenting on it, and we
will assign it to you.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can check these resources:

- http://makeapullrequest.com/
- http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first! üéâ

## Getting started

### Create an issue

Before creating a new issue, make sure to
[search](https://github.com/Heatblur-Simulations/f-4e-manual/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for
existing issues first.

If the issue already exists, comment on it saying that you intend to work on it,
and we will assign it to you!

In case it doesn't, feel free to open a new issue describing what you would like
to change, improve or fix. The community will then discuss the issue, and assign
it to you.

Now you are ready to do some work!

### Create a fork

Then, you fork the repository.

The repository has one main branches:

- `master`

Your work will be based off this branch.

To incorporate new commits from `master` into your feature branch, use
`git pull --rebase` or equivalent GUI action. We strongly prefer having linear
history, and PRs with merge commits will have to be squashed before the merge,
which results in losing all valuable commit history.

### Commit your changes

After a portion of feature you are working on is done, it's time to commit your
changes!

Each commit should be small, self-contained, and should solve only one problem.

Each commit name and message should be clear, concise, and informative: Please
consider checking these resources:
[writing a commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and
[writing a good commit message](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)

### Create a pull request

When you are done, you will create a
[pull request](https://github.com/Heatblur-Simulations/f-4e-manual/pulls) to request
feedback from the rest of the community. At this point, your contribution will be
automatically tested and then checked by a member of the Heatblur Team.

Each pull request should be clear, concise, and informative. Please consider
checking these resources:
[writing a great pull request](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/)
and
[unwritten guide to pull requests](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/written-unwritten-guide-pull-requests).

A pull request should only implement one feature or bugfix. If you want to add
or fix more than one thing, please submit another pull request.

### Automated checks and review

After you created a PR, automated checks will be run. PR cannot be merged
without all tests passing, so make sure to fix all the issues that are found.

Your PR will be reviewed, and after being accepted by at least one member of
the Heatblur Team, it will get merged to the `master` branch! üéâ

From there on, it will lead to an automatic re-deployment of the manual and your
changes being live on the real website!

## Community

Enjoy and have fun üëç
