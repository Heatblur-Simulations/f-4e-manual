<h2 id="bobweights-vs-bellows"><a class="header" href="#bobweights-vs-bellows">Bobweights vs. Bellows</a></h2>
<p>Linkages between stick, control surfaces and interactions with the trim system,
as well as the AFCS are a complex combination of forces that balance out each
other.</p>
<p>Bobweights connected to the stick increase the force required to move it
depending on the current G-force by pushing the stick forward. For example, when
pulling the stick and generating positive G's, the bobweights get heavier,
making it harder to pull more and naturally leading to the stick wanting to move
back to neutral.</p>
<p>The bobweights are countered from the opposing direction by the bellows
system operated by ram air pressure sensed at the bellows inlet on the vertical
fin.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_f4_anti_col_light.jpg" alt="Bellows Inlet" /></p>
<p>The bellows pull the stick aft depending on the relative airspeed.
For example, when going hands off stick and the aircraft unintentionally departing
nose down, airspeed increases and the bellows system pulls the stick aft, naturally
causing the aircraft to pitch up and stabilize in level flight again.</p>
<p>Trimming the aircraft results in changing the length of the lever arm connecting
the bellows system with the stick, changing the effective force they can apply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🟡 Blockage or freezing of the bellows inlet cause the system to malfunction.
In this case, trim can be rendered ineffective and sudden pitch up or down
movements can occur, depending on how the bellows and bobweight forces balance
out. To prevent another sudden change in pitch once the blockage is resolved,
trim should be kept neutral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two opposing forces are carefully balanced out to keep the stick in a
neutral position during level flight at normal airspeeds. However, due to the
dynamic nature of the system, the aircraft constantly has to be retrimmed after
even the smallest flight condition changes. Especially under G's or when changing
airspeed, the feel of the stick behavior changes drastically.</p>
<h2 id="control-sticks"><a class="header" href="#control-sticks">Control Sticks</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_stick.jpg" alt="FlightStick" /></p>
<p>A control stick is provided in both cockpits, with near-uniform switchology
between the two. A Trim Control (<num>1</num>) is found on both sticks to provide force
reduction and minor flight path correction in the pitch and roll axis. Weapons
are deliverable through both a Trigger (<num>3</num>)
(for <a href="../../stores/air_to_air/overview.html">air-to-air missiles</a> and the <a href="../../stores/guns.html">gun</a>)
and a Bomb Release Switch (<num>2</num>). Both sticks carry
a <a href="gear_ground_handling.html#nose-gear-steering">Nose Wheel Steering button (<num>5</num>)</a> that
doubles as a <a href="../radar/overview.html">radar</a> auto-acquisition control for the radar in visual
range combat, and sensor focus control for
video-directed <a href="../../stores/air_to_ground/overview.html">air to ground weapons</a>. An
<a href="gear_ground_handling.html#emergency-anti-skid-quick-release-lever">Emergency Quick Release lever (<num>6</num>)</a>
on each stick is available to immediately deactivate the anti-skid system, the automatic
flight control system, stability augmentation and the aileron-rudder
interconnect. Unique to the front cockpit control stick is the
<a href="../engines_and_fuel_systems/fuel_system.html#air-refueling-release-button">Air Refueling Release Button (<num>4</num>)</a>,
a dual-role control that performs the boom disconnect function its name implies, as well as
a number of weapon selection functions.</p>
<p>Also, unique to the front cockpit stick is a force transducer, to allow the pilot
fine adjustment control of the AFCS with the autopilot functionality engaged. In the event the force
applied to the stick exceeds the AFCS breakout limit, autopilot will be temporarily turned off.</p>
<h2 id="aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems"><a class="header" href="#aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems">Aileron-Spoiler Control and Stabilator Control Feel and Trim Systems</a></h2>
<p>The Aileron-Spoiler Control System and the Stabilator Control System both offer
trim following; the former through a screw jack actuator, the latter using a
servo directed by the AFCS.
These functions cause the stick to position relative
to the current trim and autopilot position when the crew member in control goes
"hands off". It is therefore advisable to maneuver the stick to the same
position, or to gently move the stick to "breakout force" prior to disengaging
the autopilot system to reduce the chance for an abrupt return to pilot control.</p>
<p>To confirm current state of the stabilator trim, a Stabilator Trim Position
Indicator is provided on
the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_sub_panel.html#stabilator-trim-indicator">front cockpit left vertical panel</a>
.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_stabilator_trim_indicator.jpg" alt="StabTrimInd" /></p>
<h2 id="rudder-control-system"><a class="header" href="#rudder-control-system">Rudder Control System</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_f4_rudder.jpg" alt="ext_rudder" /></p>
<p>Yaw axis control is directed by the rudder pedals found in both cockpits. To
offset any relative skidding due to wind effect, stores imbalance, or minor
<a href="../engines_and_fuel_systems/engines.html">engine</a> output deviation,
a <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#rudder-trim-switch">Rudder Trim Switch</a> is
found on
the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#inboard-engine-control-panel">engine control panel</a>
in the front cockpit. On the ground, the pedals themselves can be pressed
independently for differential braking, and the rudder axis itself functions as
the nose wheel steering directional control when
the <a href="gear_ground_handling.html#nose-gear-steering">Nose Wheel Steering button</a>
on either control stick is pressed.</p>
<h2 id="aileron-rudder-interconnect-ari"><a class="header" href="#aileron-rudder-interconnect-ari">Aileron-Rudder Interconnect (ARI)</a></h2>
<p>The aileron-rudder interconnect system causes rudder
displacement proportional to aileron displacement to
provide coordinated turns at low airspeeds. It is engaged automatically with the
<a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">Slats Flap Switch</a>
in the OUT AND DOWN
position, and the airspeed below the flap blowup speed (230
knots).</p>
<p>The limits of
the system are 15° of rudder displacement when the
automatic flight control system is in the stability
augmentation or autopilot mode, and 10° rudder
displacement when the yaw stab aug switch is disengaged.</p>
<p>The circuit breaker for the ARI is located right of the
Emergency stores release.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_ari.jpg" alt="ARIfuse" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To permanently disengage the ARI, the circuit
breaker on the left sub panel must be pulled
and the Yaw STAB AUG switch must be disengaged.
Pulling the circuit breaker with the switch
still engaged will still provide 5° of ARI rudder
authority. When the ARI circuit breaker is
pulled, the anti-skid system is disabled as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Rudder jump will occur when the ARI system cuts
in or out with a lateral control stick input. This
will normally occur when the flaps are raised or
lowered during a turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="emergency-disconnect"><a class="header" href="#emergency-disconnect">Emergency Disconnect</a></h3>
<p>In the event either seat in command requires the ARI deactivated, the system can be disconnected by
pulling
the <a href="gear_ground_handling.html#emergency-anti-skid-quick-release-lever">Emergency Quick Release Lever</a>
on their respective control stick. When the
switch is released, the ARI (10°) and the Yaw STAB AUG (5°)
rudder authority is regained. Function of the ARI
can always be overridden through the rudder pedals.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-flight-control-system-afcs---anasa-32"><a class="header" href="#automatic-flight-control-system-afcs---anasa-32">Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) - AN/ASA-32</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_afcs_control_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_afcs_switches" /></p>
<p>The automatic flight control system (AFCS) is an
electro-hydraulic system designed to provide stable,
accurate, and coordinated flight maneuvers without
interfering with manual control. The automatic flight
control system is capable of performing two modes of
operation, <strong>stability augmentation</strong> and <strong>AFCS</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The term "AFCS" is the name of the whole system but also
its sub-mode in which the aircraft attitude and/or heading
is held and altitude hold can be activated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stability augmentation</strong> improves airplane stability in pitch, roll,
and yaw. It opposes any change of attitude but does not
return the airplane to a given attitude or ground track.
This mode of operation may be used while the aircraft is
under manual control. Stability augmentation can be
engaged individually or in any combination for pitch, roll,
or yaw axis.</p>
<p>The <strong>AFCS mode</strong> of operation maintains any
aircraft heading and/or attitude selected within the AFCS
limits and corrects for any deviation from the selected
heading or attitude of the aircraft within the AFCS limits.
The AFCS switch (<num>2</num>) can be engaged with only
the Pitch STAB AUG switch engaged; however, to provide full
AFCS operation, all three STAB AUG switches must be
engaged.</p>
<p>The AFCS system can be engaged and hold maneuvers and
attitudes within a range of ±70° pitch, 70° in bank and 360°
in azimuth, providing the G limits are not being exceeded.
Rapid stabilator movements, whether pilot induced or
not, will cause the AFCS switch to disengage.</p>
<p>If the AFCS switch
is engaged when the airplane is less than ± 5° from wings level,
then the the airplane will maintain a <strong>wings level attitude</strong>,
and will hold the engaged <strong>heading</strong>.
When the nose gear steering button
(on the stick grip) is pressed, heading hold
drops out and <strong>attitude</strong> hold is available. Heading hold
can be re-established by once again pressing the nose
gear steering button. If the airplane attitude is greater
than ± 5° from wings level when the AFCS switch is
engaged, then the airplane will maintain the bank attitude at
the time of engagement.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altitude Hold mode</strong> of operation (<num>3</num>) holds
any altitude selected while in the <strong>AFCS mode</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Altimeter fluctuations while accelerating
through the transonic range (0.9 to 1.0 Mach) will produce
transient fluctuations which, although not violent, may
cause the reference altitude to slip. Engaging the altitude
hold mode in climbs greater than 1000 feet per minute
may result in a reference altitude other than the engage
altitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="force-transducer"><a class="header" href="#force-transducer">Force Transducer</a></h3>
<p>The force transducer senses the physical force applied to
the control stick. This unit comprises the visible
portion of the control stick with the stick grip mounted on
top of it.</p>
<p>The force transducer contains pressure sensitive
switches which react to longitudinal and lateral stick
forces. A lateral stick force of approximately 1.5 pounds
closes a force switch. When a roll force switch closes the
roll rate gyro signal in STAB AUG and the roll rate and
attitude gyro signals in AFCS mode are cut out so that
pilot initiated maneuvers are not opposed while in the
AFCS mode. The pilot maneuvers the aircraft by
mechanical linkages until the lateral stick force is reduced
to less than approximately 1.5 pounds. At this time the roll
channel is returned to normal AFCS operation.</p>
<p>A forward
stick force of 3.75 ±0.25 pounds or an aft stick force of 2.55
±0.25 pounds closes switches to operate certain AFCS
components, and cause a force sensing device to send a
signal, proportional to the applied stick force, to the servo
amplifier and stabilator position is controlled through the
AFCS.</p>
<p>There is no stick force transducer in the rear cockpit. The
AFCS and roll stab aug will oppose rear cockpit stick
inputs. Do not fly the aircraft from the rear cockpit with
AFCS engaged. Exercise care in transferring control
between cockpits while rolling with roll stab aug engaged.</p>
<h3 id="g-limit-accelerometer"><a class="header" href="#g-limit-accelerometer">G-Limit Accelerometer</a></h3>
<p>The normal load factor interlock (G-disengage) feature of
the AFCS is designed to inhibit the system from
commanding excessive load factors on the airplane. The
system reverts automatically from whatever mode is
engaged to stability augmentation in the event that +4 or
-1 G is sensed by the G-disengage
accelerometer switch.</p>
<p>This switch is mounted forward on
the radar bulkhead so that if the airplane is rotated
rapidly into a maneuver, disengagement occurs at lower
values of normal load factor due to the anticipation
resulting from the forward location sensing a component
of pitching acceleration.</p>
<p>The G-disengage feature is
inoperative outside the ±70° limits of the autopilot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: The G switch does not disengage the autopilot
under conditions of low airspeed or heavy gross
weight before the aircraft stalls. If the autopilot
remains engaged during a stall, the autopilot
provides pro-spin controls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="emergency-quick-release-lever"><a class="header" href="#emergency-quick-release-lever">Emergency Quick Release Lever</a></h3>
<p>A spring-loaded emergency quick release lever is on each
control stick. This lever operates in the same manner from
both the front and the rear cockpits.</p>
<p>Depressing the lever
causes the AFCS and altitude hold switch to return to
OFF. The stability augmentation mode, ARI and
anti-skid, are disengaged as long as the lever is held
depressed. When the lever is released, the stability
augmentation, anti-skid, and ARI are again in operation,
but the AFCS is no longer engaged.</p>
<p>To permanently
disengage the stability augmentation mode, the pitch, roll,
and yaw STAB AUG switches must be placed off. To
permanently disengage the ARI and anti-skid, the yaw
STAB AUG switch must be off and the ARI circuit breaker,
on the front cockpit left sub-panel, must be pulled.</p>

<p>An AUTOPILOT DISENGAGE indicator light is on the
telelight panel. After initial engagement of the AFCS
mode, the AUTOPILOT DISENGAGE indicator light and
the MASTER CAUTION light illuminates when the AFCS
is disengaged.</p>
<p>Both lights are extinguished by pressing the
master caution reset switch. The lights remain
extinguished until the AFCS is again engaged and
disengaged.</p>
<h3 id="pitch-aug-off-indicator-light"><a class="header" href="#pitch-aug-off-indicator-light">Pitch Aug Off Indicator Light</a></h3>
<p>The PITCH AUG OFF indicator light on the telelight
panel illuminates together with the MASTER CAUTION
light when the Pitch STAB AUG switch is not engaged
and the aircraft being powered.</p>
<p>Depressing the master caution reset button extinguishes the MASTER
CAUTION light. However, the PITCH AUG OFF light
remains illuminated until the Pitch STAB AUG switch is engaged.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-pitch-trim"><a class="header" href="#automatic-pitch-trim">Automatic Pitch Trim</a></h3>
<p>An automatic pitch-trim feature is included in the AFCS
which attempts to keep the airplane longitudinally
trimmed to the flight conditions experienced while in
AFCS mode.</p>
<p>Thus, an out-of-trim condition (which would
not be sensed while in autopilot mode) is prevented,
ensuring against an excessive pitch transient when
disengaging the autopilot.</p>
<p>The automatic pitch trim
operates at approximately 40% the speed of the normal
trim system, resulting in a slight delay after changing
flight conditions before the basic airplane is properly
trimmed. During control stick steering maneuvering, the
auto-trim is inoperative. Auto-trim operation can be
observed on the pitch trim indicator after changing flight
conditions in the AFCS mode.</p>
<h3 id="autopilot-pitch-trim-light"><a class="header" href="#autopilot-pitch-trim-light">Autopilot Pitch Trim Light</a></h3>
<p>The AUTOPILOT PITCH TRIM indicator light on the
telelight panel illuminates during AFCS
operation if the automatic pitch trim follow up is
inoperative or lagging sufficiently behind airplane
maneuvering to cause an out-of-trim condition in the
basic airplane.</p>
<h3 id="normal-operation"><a class="header" href="#normal-operation">Normal Operation</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>To engage the stability augmentation mode, place the pitch, roll, and yaw

<li>Trim aircraft in the stability augmentation mode before engaging AFCS mode.</li>
<li>To engage AFCS mode, establish an aircraft attitude within AFCS limits. Place

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Do not attempt to change pitch attitude of the
aircraft from the rear cockpit in the AFCS mode.
Since no force-transducer is in the rear cockpit
control stick, applying force will cause pitch trim
to run up and down depending on pressure
applied. If the pilot attempts to take control at
that point, violent transients may be
encountered.</p>

<h3 id="operational-precautions"><a class="header" href="#operational-precautions">Operational Precautions</a></h3>
<h4 id="roll-reversal"><a class="header" href="#roll-reversal">Roll Reversal</a></h4>
<p>There is a possibility of a condition called roll reversal occurring when
operating the automatic flight control system in the AFCS mode. This condition
occurs infrequently and is apparent only when attempting small changes in bank
angle. Roll reversal is associated with a small out-of-trim condition in the
lateral channel, and is apparent as a slow rolling of the airplane in the
opposite direction of the stick force. If, for instance, the airplane is out of
trim laterally to the left when the AFCS mode is engaged, roll reversal may occur
when right stick forces are applied. A roll reversal situation may be caused by
operating the manual lateral trim button while in the AFCS mode, followed by
small stick forces being applied opposite to the direction of the trim. There is
a possibility of roll reversal occurring even if the airplane has been trimmed
prior to engaging the AFCS mode, and the manual trim button has not been touched.
This condition is caused by changes in airplane trim accompanying changed flight
conditions. In view of the above, the following instructions should be observed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trim airplane in stability augmentation mode before engaging AFCS mode.</li>
<li>Do not operate manual lateral trim while the AFCS mode is engaged. If roll
reversal is encountered due to change in flight condition; disengage roll,
retrim, then reengage.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pitch-oscilattions"><a class="header" href="#pitch-oscilattions">Pitch oscilattions</a></h4>
<p>When using the altitude hold mode, the aircraft may experience pitch oscillations
in the transonic regions due to fluctuations in the air data computer airspeed
system. The nature of these oscillations vary from stick pumping to divergent pitch
oscillations. It is recommended that if pitch oscillations occur at transonic speeds,
the following corrective steps be attempted:</p>
<ol>
<li>AFCS switch – DISENGAGE</li>
<li>Static pressure compensator switch – OFF</li>
<li>AFCS switch – ENGAGE</li>
<li>Engage altitude hold mode</li>
</ol>
<p>If the oscillations persist after the above action, or if they are encountered at supersonic speeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disengage altitude hold mode.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>🔴 WARNING: Divergent pitch oscillations should not be allowed to develop.
If any divergent pitch activity is noted, corrective action should be taken
immediately.</p>

<h2 id="slats-flap-system"><a class="header" href="#slats-flap-system">Slats Flap System</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_slats_and_flaps.jpg" alt="ext_slats_and_flaps" /></p>
<p>The Slats Flap system is manually selected for takeoff and landing, then
automatically controlled relative to AoA for best handling performance in all
other flight regimes. Control is through
a <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three position switch</a> found
outboard of the left <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#throttles">throttle</a>
handle in the front cockpit and driven by the aircraft hydraulic system.
The <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three switch positions</a> are
Norm, Out, and Out and Down, and the resulting command can be moderated based on whether or not the
landing gear is being deployed.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/SlatsRelative.jpg" alt="SlatsRelative" /></p>
<p>Norm is the standard in-flight position, locking the Flaps and automatically
programming the Slat deployment as a function of AoA.</p>
<p>Out deploys the Slats to their fully deployed position. Should the landing gear
be deployed, both the Slats and Flaps will deploy.</p>
<p>Out and Down fully deploys both the Slats and the Flaps. Should the landing gear
not be down, the Wheels Light on
the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight</a> Panel will
illuminate and flash.</p>
<p>Both cockpits have
a <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_sub_panel.html#slatsflaps-indicators">Slats Flap Indicator</a>, which read In
and Out, along with a
barber-pole reading when the surfaces are in transition.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_slats_flaps_indicator.jpg" alt="SltFlpInd" /></p>
<p>In the Norm position, Maneuvering Slat deployment is a function of AoA; above
11.5 units they will extend, then retract when the aircraft is reduced below
10.5 units. Maneuvering Slat operation includes a speed-induced blowback; slats
will retract due to air pressure between 568 and 602 knots.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_slats_override_switch.jpg" alt="Slats Override" /></p>
<p>To the rear of the Fuel Control Panel in the front cockpit is the Slat Override Switch. Guarded,
this switch has two positions: NORM and IN. Defaulted to NORM under the guard, switching to IN
forces the retraction of the slats, no matter the current aircraft AoA or state of the Slats Flap
Switch position; this action will trigger the SLATS IN warning on
the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight</a> Panel and
illuminate the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/right_main_panel.html#master-caution-light">Master Caution</a>.</p>
<p>The Slats Flaps system also has an Emergency system; handles are found on the
<a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">Slats Flaps control panel</a> in
the front cockpit, and next to the rear cockpit
<a href="../../cockpit/wso/left_console/center_section.html#throttles">throttle</a> pair. The emergency system
uses pneumatic pressure, and does not
require electrical power to force deployment. The emergency system can only
function once, and can be actuated at any airspeed; however, above 230 knots,
the Flaps will retract based on air pressure, and the normal Slat retraction
speeds also apply.</p>
<h2 id="speed-brakes"><a class="header" href="#speed-brakes">Speed Brakes</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_f4_speed_brakes.jpg" alt="ext_speed_brakes_out" /></p>
<p>Underneath the aircraft and close to the rear <a href="../../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">Sparrow</a> recesses
are the <a href="../..">speed
brakes</a>, installed on the wings. The speed brakes are driven by the aircraft's
hydraulic system and actuated by
a <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#throttles">three position switch</a> found on the
inboard throttle in both cockpits.
Either switch will actuate the brakes. The positions
are Out, Stop, and In; the Out position is momentary and reverts back to Stop when released.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_speed_brake.jpg" alt="pilot_speed_brake" /></p>
<p>Brake actuation illuminates the Speed Brake Out Indicator Light found on the
<a href="../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight Panel</a>. Brake
deployment and illumination of the Indicator does not
trigger the <a href="../../cockpit/pilot/right_main_panel.html#master-caution-light">Master Caution</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_speedbrake_out.jpg" alt="SpeedBrakeLight" /></p>
<h2 id="angle-of-attack-system"><a class="header" href="#angle-of-attack-system">Angle of Attack System</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_aoa_f4.jpg" alt="ext_aoa_diagram" /></p>
<p>To precisely monitor and control aircraft flight performance, the Angle of
Attack System (AoA) provides visual and audio confirmation of current
parameters. Included in the system are the Angle of Attack Indicators found in
both cockpits, the illuminated Angle of Attack Indexers, as well as the AoA
Aural Tone System.</p>
<p>The angle of attack is typically measured in degrees (°). It represents the deviation from the
alignment of the chord line of the airplane with the oncoming air or relative wind.</p>
<h3 id="indicators"><a class="header" href="#indicators">Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_angle_of_attack_indicator.jpg" alt="AoAInd" /></p>
<p>The Angle of Attack Indicator dials register AoA values from 0 to 30 units, with
indications for weight-relative optimum altitude cruise (7.9 units), approach
(19.2 units), and stall (30 units).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The AoA Indexers are only lit with the right gear down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AoA units do not directly translate to degrees, one unit of AoA is
the same as roughly 0.95 degrees and the measured AoA is also offset
by about 4 degrees. This way, the indicator displays a more natural and useful
value to the crew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Extension of the landing gear and thus the nose
gear door changes the airflow around the probe causing to indicate higher
angles by 1 unit. The approach airspeeds account for that. Therefore, performing
an approach with the gear retracted, will cause the indicators to show
approximately 1 unit low, and the aircraft will be roughly 5 knots fast for an
on-speed approach.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="indexers"><a class="header" href="#indexers">Indexers</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_overhead_aoa_indexer.jpg" alt="AoA" /></p>
<p>The AoA Indexers, found on the windshield frame of the front cockpit, and above
the instrument panel in the rear, display color coded and directional symbology
for the on-speed approach value of 19.2 units once the landing gear have been
lowered.</p>
<h2 id="aural-tone-system"><a class="header" href="#aural-tone-system">Aural Tone System</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/AoA_aural_tone_chart_slats_in_or_gear_down.jpg" alt="manual_aural_tone_chart_slats_in" />
<img src="../../img/AoA_aural_tone_chart_slats_out_and_landing_gear_up.jpg" alt="manual_aural_tone_chart_slats_out" /></p>
<p>The Aural Tone System provides audible feedback in maneuvering flight and during
landing configuration. Beginning above 15 units AoA with gear down, and 21 units
AoA with the gear up and slats in, a pulse will be heard by both crew-members.</p>
<p>The rate of the pulse can vary from 1.5 to 20 pulses per second, with increasing
frequency based on higher AoA values.</p>
<p>This tone can be lowered in volume below 20.3 units AoA gear down/25 units gear
up with controls in each cockpit; exceeding these values will cause the system
to override the volume limits and deliver the warning pulses at a minimum
volume to ensure they are audible regardless of volume setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The respective knobs are labelled STALL WARNING and can be found on the right
side in either cockpit. They must not to be confused with the AURAL TONE CONTROL
knobs, which control weapon related tones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to limited forward visibility, the tones are a crucial aid during landing.
If a low pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too fast.
If a high pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too slow.
For the proper on-speed configuration, a steady tone at a medium pitch is played.</p>
<h2 id="stall-warning-vibrator"><a class="header" href="#stall-warning-vibrator">Stall Warning Vibrator</a></h2>
<p>The left front cockpit pedal includes a Stall Warning Vibrator, which is
activated over 22.3 units Angle of Attack. This physical (and in DCS audible)
indication is given to make the pilot aware of the potential of an impending
stall and provide enough time to reduce AoA and prevent the loss of control of
the aircraft. Reducing AoA below the threshold will deactivate the warning.</p>
