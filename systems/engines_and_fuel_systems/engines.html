specialists and Air Force maintenance technicians remove an engine from an F-4
Phantom II aircraft at the F-4 maintenance depot</em></p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom is powered by two J79-GE-17 engines built by General Electric,
with a rated static sea-level power delivery of 11,870 pounds of thrust in Mil,
and 17,900 pounds in afterburner. The engines have provision for both assisted
pneumatic start at fields with an available cart, or via a propellant cartridge
to initiate spin-up. Similarly, the engines can utilize the aircraft's internal
battery for initial power, or connection with an external power cart.</p>

<p>ðŸ’¡ When the engines are off they make a rattling noise as the respective
blades rattle in their holders.</p>

<h2 id="principle"><a class="header" href="#principle">Principle</a></h2>
<p>The J97 engine is an axial-flow turbojet engine. It can roughly be divided into
the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inlet</li>
<li>Compressor</li>
<li>Combustion Chambers</li>
<li>Turbine and Gear</li>
<li>Afterburner</li>
<li>Exhaust Nozzles</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_museum_open.jpg" alt="Open Engine in Museum" /></p>
<h3 id="inlet"><a class="header" href="#inlet">Inlet</a></h3>
<p>Outside airflow enters the engine at the inlet, from where it is routed to the
compressor.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_inlet.jpg" alt="Inlet" /></p>
<p>The majority of the air entering the inlet flows through what is called the
<strong>Air Bypass</strong>. The bypass leads the air straight to the exhaust nozzle, where
it produces the <strong>thrust</strong> that moves the aircraft forward.</p>
<p>The remaining air is used by the combustion system in order to accelerate the
compressor, effectively leading to more air being sucked in - which in turn
increases the thrust produced.</p>
<p>Optimization of air to the engines is performed by a <strong>Variable Duct Ramp</strong>
system directed by the Automatic Duct Control (ADC); this optimization uses a
pair of variable ramps to decelerate incoming air to subsonic for best engine
performance.</p>
<p>In the event limits are exceeded for inlet temperature, the Duct Temperature
High Indicator Light (DUCT TEMP HI) on the telelight panel will illuminate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸŸ¡ CAUTION: Permitting the issue to continue can cause permanent engine
damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="compressor"><a class="header" href="#compressor">Compressor</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_compressor.jpg" alt="Compressor" /></p>
<p>The compressor consists of 17-stages of arranged blades through which air is
routed. The pathway consistently gets narrower, leading to the air getting
compressed. Compressed air heats up, the temperature rises.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this process is commonly referred to as the Compressor
Pressure Ratio (CPR). For the J79 air is typically compressed up to a ratio of
12:1.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/compressor_open.jpg" alt="Open Compressor in Museum" /></p>
<h4 id="compressor-stall"><a class="header" href="#compressor-stall">Compressor Stall</a></h4>
<p>In specific situations it is possible for the airflow in the compressor
to stall or even flow in reverse, back out of the front.</p>
<p>The consequence are interruptions in the combustion chambers, as they do not
receive the necessary air anymore to create a proper mixture for ignition.</p>
<p>In best cases this only leads to temporarily reduced thrust.
In worst cases the combustion chambers surge and ignition seizes,
requiring a complete restart of the respective engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸ’¡ Compressor Stalls in the F-4E are generally rare to encounter.
Avoid excessive, sudden and abrupt throttle movements.
Try to maintain a smooth flight without any sudden and high-AoA moves
to not interrupt the airflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="combustion-chamber"><a class="header" href="#combustion-chamber">Combustion Chamber</a></h3>
<p>Hot and compressed air leaves the compressor and enters several combustion
chambers.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_combustion.jpg" alt="Combustion Chamber" /></p>
<p>Multiple nozzles inject fuel into the chamber, creating a specific mix of air
and fuel.</p>
<p>This mixture is initially ignited by a spark plug during engine startup.
Afterwards the mixture stays ignited and continues to burn on its own.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/combustion_chamber_open.jpg" alt="Open Combustion Chamber in Museum" /></p>
<h3 id="turbine-and-gear"><a class="header" href="#turbine-and-gear">Turbine and Gear</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_turbine_gear.jpg" alt="Turbine and Gear Shaft" /></p>
<p>The ignition leads to very hot and fast air being forced out of the combustion
chambers, where it hits a 3-stage arrangement of blades called the turbine.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_turbine_open.jpg" alt="Open Turbine in Museum" /></p>
<p>This leads to rotation of the turbine assembly, which is connected to a gear
shaft that the compressor blades are connected to as well.</p>
<p>In turn, this causes the compressor assembly to rotate and accelerate, which
causes more outside air to be sucked into the inlet.</p>
<p>This design, together with fuel being injected for combustion, ensures that the
engine, once started, continues to operate and produce thrust on its own.</p>
<h3 id="afterburner"><a class="header" href="#afterburner">Afterburner</a></h3>
<p>Optionally, the produced thrust can be increased further at the cost of
significantly more fuel being used. This is commonly referred to as
<em>Afterburner</em>, or also <em>Reheat</em>.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_afterburner.jpg" alt="Afterburner" /></p>
<p>The afterburner system consists of multiple spray bars that inject more fuel
into the hot air leaving the combustion chambers.</p>

<p>This air-fuel mixture is then burned by a torch, initially ignited by a spark
plug that supplying a continuous arc.</p>

<h3 id="exhaust-nozzles"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-nozzles">Exhaust Nozzles</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_nozzles.jpg" alt="Exhaust Nozzles" /></p>
<p>The last section of the engine is the exhaust where air from the Combustion
Chambers and Afterburner section, as well as air from the Air Bypass leave the
engine to propel the aircraft forward.</p>
<p>Efficiency is of the process is controlled by variable exhaust nozzles that open
and close in order to direct the exhaust airstream. These nozzles are operated
hydraulically by oil.</p>
<h2 id="starting-system"><a class="header" href="#starting-system">Starting System</a></h2>
<p>In order for the engine to start, several things need to be accomplished.</p>
<h3 id="gear-shaft-rotation"><a class="header" href="#gear-shaft-rotation">Gear Shaft Rotation</a></h3>
<p>First, the gear shaft needs to rotate at a minimum speed, so that the compressor
blades begin to suck in enough air.</p>
<p>There are two ways to accomplish this in the F-4.</p>
<h3 id="pneumatic-mode-starting"><a class="header" href="#pneumatic-mode-starting">Pneumatic Mode Starting</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/ext_ground_cart.jpg" alt="ext_cart" /></p>
<p>The pneumatic mode is the primary starting mode for all normal and routine
operations. In this mode the Phantom utilizes an auxiliary start cart that turns
the starter turbine, cranking the engine by use of external air flow.</p>
<p>The cart is operated by the crew chief, see the
<a href="../../crew_chief/overview.html">Crew Chief chapter</a> for more information about
how to interact and request air supply.</p>
<h3 id="cartridge-mode-starting"><a class="header" href="#cartridge-mode-starting">Cartridge Mode Starting</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/f_4_cartridge_start.jpg" alt="f_4_cartridge_start" /></p>
<p>Cartridge mode is considered an alternate method of starting supplied for
operational and emergency needs. A propellant charge is used to turn the starter
turbine, which in turn cranks the engine to initiate startup.</p>
<p>Cartridge ignition is controlled by the engine start switch providing the
respective engine master switch is on. Selecting L or R ignites the cartridge
installed for the respective engine.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_engine_start_switch.jpg" alt="StartSwitch" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸ’¡ To avoid possible irritation caused by cartridge exhaust smoke/gases, it
may be advisable to close canopies and select 100% oxygen during start cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cartridges can be installed by the crew chief, see the
<a href="../../crew_chief/overview.html">Crew Chief chapter</a> for how to interact and
request cartridges installation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸ”´ WARNING: Cartridges are explosive and, unless fired, must not be forgotten
to be removed. Under no circumstances will the aircraft be flown with unfired
cartridges in the starter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="engine-fuel-system"><a class="header" href="#engine-fuel-system">Engine Fuel System</a></h3>
<p>Second, the combustion chambers need to inject fuel into the air.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/engine_fuel_flow.jpg" alt="Engine Fuel System" /></p>
<p>Fuel is supplied through booster pumps installed in Fuel Tank Cell 1.</p>
<p>The amount of fuel is controlled through the throttle position and fuel flow can
be started by opening the respective <strong>Engine Fuel Shutoff Valve</strong>. The valve is
opened by moving the throttle out of the OFF position.</p>
<h4 id="engine-master-switches"><a class="header" href="#engine-master-switches">Engine Master Switches</a></h4>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_engine_master_switches.jpg" alt="EngineMasterSwitches" /></p>
<p>A pair of two-position Engine Master Switches are found on the front cockpit
left console on the inboard engine control panel.</p>
<p>Selecting ON powers the fuel boost and transfer pumps for the respective engine;
this will occur whether the aircraft is connected to external auxiliary power or
not, as doing so without will connect the aircraft battery to the pump circuits.</p>
<p>As the Engine Master Switches arm the fuel shutoff valves, to properly shut down
the engines without external power it is necessary to return the throttles to
the cutoff position prior to turning the Engine Master Switches off, otherwise
the valves will remain open.</p>
<h3 id="ignition-system"><a class="header" href="#ignition-system">Ignition System</a></h3>
<p>Third, the air-fuel mixture inside the chamber needs to initially be ignited
with a spark.</p>
<p>Therefore, the -17E/G engine is equipped with one 28 volt, low energy ignition
unit and one 28 volt high energy unit that improves ground starts in cold
weather and air starts using alternate fuel. The main ignition system produces
an electrical arc which ignites the atomized fuel-air mixture in the fourth and
fifth combustion chambers. The remaining eight combustion chambers are ignited
through the crossfire tubes.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_ignition_button.jpg" alt="Ignition Buttons" /></p>
<p>Pressing the ignition button on each throttle causes the spark plugs to
discharge, igniting the fuel-air mixture as the throttle is moved from OFF to
IDLE during engine start. The spark plugs only fire while the spring-loaded
ignition button is held.</p>
<h3 id="afterburner-ignition-system"><a class="header" href="#afterburner-ignition-system">Afterburner Ignition System</a></h3>
<p>The afterburner ignition system consists of the torch igniter, a spark plug and
an afterburner ignition switch. When the throttle is moved into the afterburner
detent, the afterburner ignition switch closes, and the spark plug supplies a
continuous arc. Ignition and torch igniter fuel flow are maintained until the
throttle is removed from the afterburner detent.</p>
<h2 id="oil-system"><a class="header" href="#oil-system">Oil System</a></h2>
<p><img src="../../img/manual_engine_oil_system.jpg" alt="manual_engine_oil_system" /></p>
<p>Each engine is equipped with a completely self-contained, dry sump, full
pressure oil system. The oil supply to the lubrication system is interrupted
during negative G-flight due to the inability of the scavenge pumps to recover
oil from the sumps and gear boxes.</p>
<p>The Engine Oil system is used for lubrication, variable nozzle positioning and
constant speed drive unit operation.</p>
<p>The standpipes which supply the three systems utilizing engine oil are in the
reservoir such that the pipe for the constant speed drive unit is the highest,
the one for the nozzle control is the next highest, and the lubricating system
pipe is the lowest. This arrangement is to prevent a critical system failure if
one of the circuits leak. If a leak in the constant speed drive unit would occur
it will probably cause a failure of that system only, while a leak in the nozzle
control system may cause failure of that system and the constant speed drive
unit.</p>
<p>Oil is also supplied directly from the reservoir to the constant speed drive
unit, where it is used as both the control and final drive medium for
controlling generator speed. The lubrication element of the oil pump supplies
oil to cool and lubricate bearings, gears and other rubbing or moving parts in
the engine. Lubricating oil is also circulated through the engine-driven
generator for cooling purposes.</p>
<h3 id="oil-pressure-indicators"><a class="header" href="#oil-pressure-indicators">Oil Pressure Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_engine_oil.jpg" alt="OilPress" /></p>
<p>Oil pressure indicators are on the front cockpit pedestal panel, and calibrated
from 0 to 100 PSI. Important values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 psi - Minimum at idle RPM</li>
<li>30-60 psi - In-flight military</li>
<li>35 psi - Static minimum at military thrust</li>
<li>60 psi - Maximum</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../img/pilot_anti_ice_switch.jpg" alt="EngineDeIcing" /></p>
<p>Using the Anti-Icing Switch set to DE-ICE, bleed air from stage 17 is
distributed to ports installed in the compressor face area of the engines.</p>
<p>This system does not perform de-icing functions, but is to be activated prior to
ice formation. As high Mach speeds provide enough friction heat to the air
stream to deny icing in the compressor stage, usage of the Anti-Icing System is
unnecessary and can cause engine damage.</p>
<p>The system should be turned on in turbulent air and thunderstorms, or when a
rise in Exhaust Gas temperature is noted by the pilot as this is an indication
for an engine icing condition.</p>
<h3 id="anti-ice-indicator-lights"><a class="header" href="#anti-ice-indicator-lights">Anti-Ice Indicator Lights</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_anti_ice_indicators.jpg" alt="pilot_anti_ice_indicator_lights" /></p>
<p>Activation of the Anti-Icing system will illuminate two lights on the telelight
panel, L ANTI-ICE On and R ANTI-ICE On. A failure of the anti-icing system with
the Anti-Icing Switch set to NORMAL will also light these telelight indicators
as a warning. If the aircraft is above Mach 1.2 when this occurs, immediate
speed reduction is necessary to prevent engine loss. Because of the warning
function for the ANTI-ICE ON lamps, a condition that illuminates them will
provide a MASTER CAUTION warning.</p>
<h3 id="exhaust-nozzle-system"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-nozzle-system">Exhaust Nozzle System</a></h3>
<h4 id="control-unit"><a class="header" href="#control-unit">Control Unit</a></h4>
<p>Throttle position, nozzle position feedback and exhaust gas temperature are
utilized to schedule the correct nozzle area. During engine operation in the
sub-mil region, the nozzle area is primarily a function of throttle angle and
nozzle position feedback.</p>
<p>The nozzle is scheduled to approximately 7/8th open at idle and the area is
decreased as the throttle is advanced toward the military power position.
However, during a rapid throttle burst from below 79% rpm to 98% rpm, a control
alternator supplies engine speed information to the temperature amplifier, which
in turn schedules engine speed inputs as a function of temperature limiting.
This signal prevents the primary nozzle from closing beyond a preset position,
permitting a rapid increase in engine rpm that could damage the engine.</p>
<p>During engine operation in the military and afterburner region, it becomes
necessary to limit the nozzle schedule as established by the throttle angle and
nozzle feedback to prohibit exhaust gas temperature from exceeding engine design
limits and damaging the engine.</p>
<h4 id="position-indicators"><a class="header" href="#position-indicators">Position Indicators</a></h4>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_nozzle_position.jpg" alt="NPI" /></p>
<p>Directed by the Exhaust Nozzle Control Unit, the paired primary (the convergent,
inner nozzle) and secondary (the divergent, outer nozzle) are actuated
independently on a schedule to maximize outlet performance versus exhaust gas
temperature. When idle, the engine nozzle will be roughly 7/8ths open, reducing
in size as the throttle approaches MIL. During operation in the MIL and AB
regions, the Control Unit moderates the nozzle size relative to throttle
position and received EGT to maintain temperatures within design limit.</p>
<p>To monitor the current position of the nozzles relative to each other, as well
as EGTs, an indicator is provided with calibrations from CLOSE to OPEN in four
increments. The nozzle indicators enable the pilot to make a comparison of
nozzle position between engines and are also used to establish a relationship
between nozzle position and exhaust gas temperature, as well as nozzle position
and throttle settings.</p>
<p>Normal settings would be OPEN with the engines off until IDLE, 3/4 to 1/2 with
engines in IDLE and 1/4 for MIL power. MAX power will not change the indicator.</p>
<h2 id="operation"><a class="header" href="#operation">Operation</a></h2>
<h3 id="throttles"><a class="header" href="#throttles">Throttles</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_throttle.jpg" alt="Throttles" /></p>
<p>Paired throttles are provided in both cockpits for engine thrust control. In
normal use, movement of the throttles from IDLE to OFF will perform fuel cutoff;
to prevent inadvertent engine shutdown, a pair of finger lifts (<num>3</num>)
are provided to lock out the OFF position without performing this actuation.
Afterburner is attained by shifting the throttles outboard (left) at the MIL
stop, then pushing them forward.</p>
<p>The rear cockpit throttles are connected to the front throttles in such a
fashion that only the pilot can start the engines or enter the afterburner
range; the WSO can reduce throttles out of the afterburner region back into MIL
operation and lower. While the rear throttles can be shifted from OFF without
pilot assistance, return to OFF for shutdown requires pilot engagement of the
finger lifts.</p>
<p>In the event of opposing commands on the throttle arms between seats, the rear
throttles will be disconnected from the front throttles to prevent damage to the
linkage. This condition may cause a reduction in afterburner authority from the
front throttle pair. Resetting the throttle linkage is performed by placing the
front throttles at the IDLE or MIL stop and moving the rear throttles in the
opposite direction to which the disconnect occurred.</p>
<p>The rear throttles only hold a microphone button and speed brake switch.</p>
<h3 id="tachometers"><a class="header" href="#tachometers">Tachometers</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_rpm.jpg" alt="Tach" /></p>
<p>Both engines are provided with tachometers on the right side of the front
cockpit instrument panel, and the right side of the rear cockpit instrument
panel. The tachometers will function without external power.</p>
<h3 id="fuel-flow-indicators"><a class="header" href="#fuel-flow-indicators">Fuel Flow Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_fuel_flow.jpg" alt="FFI" /></p>
<p>Each engine has a fuel flow indicator found in the front cockpit instrument.</p>
<p>The indicators read in thousands of pounds per hour, from 0 to 12. The
indicators provide flow rate up to Mil power; when afterburner is engaged, a
separate fuel delivery system is used to provide fuel directly to the
afterburner stage, and the flow rate is approximately 4 times the value shown.
The engine speed is also controlled by the fuel flow, so a change in fuel flow
can be directly observed if the throttles are moved.</p>
<p>Fuel Flow should not exceed 1200 pph at lightoff and 800 to 1500 pph at idle
operations. Fuel consumption for Engine start is approximately 65 pounds per
Engine.</p>
<h3 id="exhaust-gas-temperature-indicators"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-gas-temperature-indicators">Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/pilot_egt.jpg" alt="EGT" /></p>
<p>Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicators are found on the front cockpit instrument
panel. The indicators have two pointers each: a large pointer for the 0 to 12
scale referencing 100 degrees centigrade, and a smaller pointer on a separate
scale with 0 to 10 referencing 10 degrees centigrade. Measuring for these values
is performed upon exit of the turbine. For normal operations the exhaust gas
temperature should not be less than 250Â°C and should not exceed more than 540Â°C.
If an over-temperature Event occurs the throttle should be returned to the off
position. If that is not possible the respective engine master switch should be
turned off.</p>
