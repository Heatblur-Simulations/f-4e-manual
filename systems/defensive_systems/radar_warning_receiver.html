<p><img src="../../img/rwr_happy_face.jpg" alt="rwr_happy_face" /></p>
<p>The ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver (subsequently RWR) is the F-4E's passive situational awareness
system for detection of airborne and surface-to-air radar threats. The system captures signals from
multiple pairs of directional antennas installed at the aft of the fuselage, on each wingtip and
under the nose; the difference in relative timing of detection and angle by the antennas is used by
the system to define a relative bearing to the emitting radar. Further processing of the received
radiation references the stored threat catalog to identify emitter type, as well as to define a
relative threat range as a function of received power versus known output.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/rwr_with_contacts.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_with_contacts" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚧 The ALR-46 is currently installed in the housing of a APR-36 earlier RWR model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resulting processed threat signal is then presented on the RWR's CRT (cathode-ray tube) display,
with bearing to the emitter shown on the display with the top relative to the nose (12 o'clock) and
the bottom the tail (6 o'clock), and with proximity to center relative to the system's calculation
of the level of threat - with closer indications being of higher danger, and those within the middle
ring being classified within engagement range. In normal operation, the ALR-46 can present 16
threats on the CRT concurrently. The highest priority threat as computed by the ALR-46's threat and
range catalog is presented on the display with a diamond superimposed by its symbol; this is
considered "floating" diamond functionality, with the ALR-46 defining priority. In the event of
possible engagement by a threat emitter (concurrent with the illumination of the ACTIVITY and/or
MISSILE LAUNCH buttons), the event is signified by a circle around the emitter symbol.</p>
<h2 id="alr-46-controls"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-controls">ALR-46 Controls</a></h2>
<h3 id="rwr-display-intensity-knob"><a class="header" href="#rwr-display-intensity-knob">RWR Display Intensity Knob</a></h3>
<p>Found adjacent to the RWR situation display in the lower left corner of the panel, the Intensity
Knob functions as a dimmer to control the brightness of the displayed RWR returns. Clockwise raises
the brightness, counter-clockwise lowers the brightness.</p>
<h3 id="excess-noise-strobe-indicators"><a class="header" href="#excess-noise-strobe-indicators">Excess Noise Strobe Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/rwr_t_strobe.jpg" alt="rwr_excess_noise_strobe" /></p>
<p>During normal operation, a trio of three T shaped indicators appear in the 9, 12, and 3 o'clock
positions near the center of the RWR CRT. These indicators signify the absence of excess noise in
the low (<num>9</num>), mid (<num>12</num>), and high (<num>3</num>) band amplifier detection. In
the event noise becomes too significant in a given amplifier channel, the indicator for the
respective band will disappear. Should this occur, a SYS TEST can be performed to confirm the
channel is still functioning; in the event of a pass, the channel can be considered working at a
reduced detection capacity.</p>
<p>A fourth indicator may appear as part of the SYS TEST or power up cycle. This fourth indicator in
the 6 o'clock position does not signify any function.</p>
<h3 id="alr-46-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-control-panel">ALR-46 Control Panel</a></h3>
<p><img src="../../img/wso_rwr_control_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_control_panel" /></p>
<p>The ALR-46 Control Panel consists of ten multipurpose, illuminated buttons, along with a pair of
rotary knobs for controlling the system's volume and panel brightness.</p>
<p>Controls are duplicated for pilot and WSO. The pilot controls are directly below the RWR Indicator,
while the controls for the WSO are found below the Central Indicator in the front of the view.</p>
<h4 id="mode"><a class="header" href="#mode">Mode</a></h4>
<p>The ALR-46 defaults on power-up to OPEN mode (<num>1</num>), which presents up to 16 threats on the
display at one time, depending on how many emitters are visible and current system settings (Search,
LOW ALT, etc.). In the event the crew requires immediate prioritization of the most pressing threats
in a saturated environment, the PRIORITY button can be pressed to display the five emitters the
system deems the most dangerous. When pressed, the OPEN illumination will swap to the PRIORITY
position, and revert back upon selection back to OPEN.</p>
<h4 id="search"><a class="header" href="#search">Search</a></h4>
<p>By default, the ALR-46 is programmed to prioritize and display emitters tied to weapons that can
engage and destroy the aircraft. However, missions will require monitoring of early warning and
search radar systems working with longer pulse-widths for extended range detection and tracking of
possible intruders - i.e., the F-4. These emitters can be displayed using the Search mode
(<num>2</num>), which presents them on the RWR with the S symbol to signify their function as a long
range search radar. Entry into Search mode is displayed on the button with an illuminated "S".</p>
<p>Because of their low threat priority, it is important to note that search radar symbology may often
fall off the display due to their reduced importance - especially when the ALR-46 is placed into
PRIORITY mode.</p>
<h4 id="handoff"><a class="header" href="#handoff">Handoff</a></h4>
<p>The Handoff button (<num>3</num>) provides the opportunity for the flight crew to define the
priority emitting threat. By default, the ALR-46 defines the highest priority threat as a function
of range, current transmitting mode, and the threat catalog. This priority threat is visualized with
a diamond superimposed around the emitter's symbol. In the event the pilot wishes to define a
different emitter as the target, the Handoff button is pressed and held to cycle the priority
diamond through the various emitters. Once the desired emitter is focused upon and surrounded with
the diamond, the button can be released, and the priority symbol will remain latched with that
emitter and the double caret (&lt;&gt;) symbol on the button illuminated to signify latched mode. With a
latched diamond focus emitter, the system will remain focused on said emitter until the signal is
either lost, the crew selects another focus emitter with the Handoff button, or the button is
pressed momentarily to return to normal floating diamond threat priority mode.</p>
<!-- ![pilot_rwr_handoff](../../img/pilot_rwr_handoff.jpg) -->
<p>In the event that the emitter is tight grouping of other symbols on the display, the TGT SEP mode
will be applied.</p>
<p>When diamond symbol is latched, the diamond (handoff) audio can be heard through the intercom. It's
a constant synthetical tone generated in the system based on the current PRF (pulse repetition
frequency) of the given emitter. It's not affected by the received power so the amplitude won't
change in time as in some other systems.</p>
<h4 id="launch"><a class="header" href="#launch">Launch</a></h4>
<p>In the event a missile launch is detected by way of discrete SAM guidance commands being received,
the MISSILE LAUNCH indications in this button (<num>4</num>) will illuminate, and a circle is
superimposed around the threat emitter defined as guiding the inbound weapon. Pressing the button
will initiate the built-in-test which provides <a href="#launch-audio">launch audio</a> through the intercom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Keep in mind that ALR-46 can detect missile launches only from certain systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../img/rwr_launch_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_missile_launch" /></p>
<h4 id="altitude"><a class="header" href="#altitude">Altitude</a></h4>
<p>The ALR-46 utilizes own-ship altitude as a defining aspect of threat priority, thus causing low
altitude AAA and SAM threats to lose priority in the event the aircraft is at an altitude that is
estimated to place it outside of their threat envelope. Activating LOW ALT mode (<num>5</num>)
removes this envelope estimate from the threat prioritization and places low altitude threats back
into priority, useful for circumstances such as a high to low dive attack or target ingress profile,
and is confirmed as the active mode with the illuminated LOW ALT descriptor on the button.</p>
<h4 id="target-separation"><a class="header" href="#target-separation">Target Separation</a></h4>
<p>In the event of a number of emitters being detected at such close proximity that the symbology
overlaps on the RWR display, the Target Separation button (<num>7</num>) provides the option to
expand symbology on the display from emitters in the same area to allow for clarity on the type and
number of radars being detected. Pressing the button triggers the lower TGT SEP illumination on the
button, and any emitter groups the system defines as being eligible for the expanded presentation
will do so for three seconds on the RWR display before reverting back to the standard view.</p>
<h4 id="system-test"><a class="header" href="#system-test">System Test</a></h4>
<p>The system power on test (<num>8</num>) provides a three band (1 low, 2 mid, 3 high) check in all
four quadrants for proper sensitivity, along with an angle confirmation of 225 degree relative
bearing for diagnostic purposes. The test sequence begins with 1s in all four quadrants, with the
lower left value in a diamond (signifying a heading of 225, which is displayed on the panel); the
second and third continue this process, cycling band 2 and band 3. The tests are accompanied with a
sequence of tones for adjustment of audio monitoring level.</p>
<p>This button is also used when switching the threat files. Exact procedure is explained in the
<a href="#symbology">symbology</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="unknown"><a class="header" href="#unknown">Unknown</a></h4>
<p>When an emitter is detected that does not have a catalog entry, but is recognized by received power,
duration, and pulse as being a possible threat, the U indicator on the Unknown button (<num>9</num>)
will flash. Pressing the button will provide a U symbol on the RWR CRT at the correct azimuth
position for reference and monitoring.</p>
<p>The default condition of the Unknown button is with the U symbol illuminated, but steady.</p>
<h4 id="activity-power"><a class="header" href="#activity-power">Activity Power</a></h4>
<p>In the event SAM guidance commands are detected, the ACTIVITY button (<num>10</num>) will
illuminate. This button's function is similar to the MISSILE LAUNCH indication insofar as that it
responds to a guidance directive to a SAM, but does not respond to discrete changeover signals.
Thus, an illuminated ACTIVITY warning may in fact indicate a launch, depending on the system
engaging the F-4 and the circumstances surrounding it. The indication will provide a circle around
the threat emitter.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/rwr_activity_light.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_activity_power" /></p>
<h4 id="system-power"><a class="header" href="#system-power">System Power</a></h4>
<p>The System Power button (<num>11</num>) is the on/off switch for the ALR-46. When pressed to
activate the system, the RWR control panel and display will cycle through their initial 9-second
warmup, with the display and illuminated buttons undergoing rapid flashing as the system is prepared
for use and proper functioning is confirmed. Search mode is deactivated by default upon startup, and
if in the event the aircraft was powered down and restarted, the altitude priority mode (LOW ALT or
normal) will be in the same state it was left prior to shut down.</p>
<p>In the event of a system power failure, the ALR-46 has an automatic restart function. Once power is
recovered, the receiver will restart after a fifteen-second delay, in addition to its 9-second power
on self test. The system will resume state in the same fashion as a normal restart - with Search
mode deactivated and the altitude priority as when power was lost.</p>
<h4 id="audio-knob"><a class="header" href="#audio-knob">Audio Knob</a></h4>
<p>The AUDIO Knob (<num>6</num>) is the direct volume control for the situational audio from the
ALR-46. Turning the knob clockwise increases the audio volume, turning counter-clockwise lowers the
audio volume.</p>
<h4 id="dim-knob-dimmer"><a class="header" href="#dim-knob-dimmer">DIM Knob (Dimmer)</a></h4>
<p>The DIM knob (<num>12</num>) on the ALR-46 control panel manages the brightness setting of the
illuminated control buttons; turning the knob clockwise increases the brightness, counter-clockwise
reduces the brightness.</p>
<h2 id="audio-alerts"><a class="header" href="#audio-alerts">Audio Alerts</a></h2>
<h3 id="new-guy-audio"><a class="header" href="#new-guy-audio">New Guy Audio</a></h3>
<p>The audio alert issued when a new emitter is first displayed, or when PRF (pulse repetition
frequency) of an existing display changes is known as <em>new guy audio</em>. It consists of three beeps
within 1.5 seconds, each at PRF of emitter which has diamond symbol. The new guy audio alerts a
crew-member to a change in threat environment so he can check his azimuth indicator for update. The
AUDIO control on indicator-control can adjust volume from maximum to completely off.</p>
<blockquote>

<a href="https://officialdsplayer.github.io/F-4E-RWR-PRF-Library/">officialdsplayer.github.io/F-4E-RWR-PRF-Library</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="launch-audio"><a class="header" href="#launch-audio">Launch Audio</a></h3>
<p>The synthetic launch tone generated when an emitter goes into launch state is called <em>launch audio</em>
or <em>ML interrupt audio</em>. It consists of approximately seven beeps in 1.5 seconds of a 1 kHz tone
generator in the signal processor. Only one launch audio is generated per launch; i.e., after
approximately seven beeps, no launch audio is heard from that emitter.</p>
<p>Volume of the launch audio is controlled by the main RWR audio knob as well as dedicated ML audio
knob in each cockpit. The resultant volume is a function of both knobs positions.</p>
<h2 id="symbology"><a class="header" href="#symbology">Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The ALR-46 features a limited number of symbols for the different radar threats. The following
symbols can stand for the different threats. The ALR-46 can save up to three files containing threat
tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>Land file (default) - land and air threats</li>
<li>Sea file - sea and air threats</li>
<li>Training file - additional configurable threats (empty by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pilot can switch between the land and the training file by simply pressing the SYS TEST
(<num>8</num>) and within a one second timespan pressing the TGT SEP (<num>7</num>) button. A T
symbol will be displayed within the lower portion of azimuth when the training file is selected. To
switch to the sea file simply press the SYS TEST (<num>8</num>) button and within a one second
timespan press the UNKNOWN (<num>9</num>) button. When the sea file is selected a ship symbol will
be displayed in the lower half of azimuth.</p>

<h2 id="threat-indications"><a class="header" href="#threat-indications">Threat Indications</a></h2>
<p>Due to weapon systems all operating very differently, the RWR indications always have to be
interpreted individually per threat platform. This requires understanding how the expected threats
work, how they guide missiles, whether they have separate search and tracking radars or similar.</p>
<p>The following table gives an overview on how the RWR indicates certain events for commonly faced
threats.</p>
<p>Actual missile launches can only be detected by the presence of C/D band guidance signals, indicated
by the <strong>LAUNCH</strong> lamp. This is the case for some SAM systems. Some actively guided radar missiles
can be identified individually and will be shown with specific Missile symbols.</p>
<p>Beyond those clear indications, missile launches are often preceded by the target platform
activating a specific tracking-radar or significantly increasing its PRF, which the RWR often picks
up and plays a <strong>New-Guy</strong> tone for (3 short beeps). Activating <strong>HANDOFF</strong> mode often makes the
high pitched PRF tone clearly audible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The presence of a tracking radar does not necessarily indicate a lock, that the weapon platform
intents to shoot or that the own aircraft is the target. However, in practice this is very often
the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Symbols <strong>S</strong> and <strong>U</strong> require activating the <strong>SEARCH</strong> and <strong>UNKNOWN</strong> mode respectively to
be shown on the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The following threats and their indications (except launch) are applicable only for the
respective threat table that the ALR-46 is currently using. For example, the Rezky's tracking
radar will display as a <strong>4</strong> on the sea file (as listed below) but will display as an <strong>8</strong> when
using the land file. It is important to be using the correct threat table for the expected threats
or confusion may occur.</p>
